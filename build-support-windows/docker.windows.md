## About this File

In this file you will find which Docker images that need to be pre-built to run the Envoy integration tests on Windows, as well as information on how to run each of these files individually for testing purposes.

## Consul-windows

The required Consul image is built from the "Dockerfile-windows" file located at the root of the project.
To do this, the official [windows/servercore image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore) is used as base image.
To build the image, use the following command:

```shell
docker build -t windows/consul -f Dockerfile-windows .
```

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8300:8300 -p 8301:8301 -p 8302:8302 -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:8600 --name consul --hostname "consul-primary-server" --network-alias "consul-primary-server" windows/consul agent -dev -datacenter "primary" -grpc-port -1 -client "0.0.0.0" -bind "0.0.0.0"
```

If everything works properly you should openning the browser and check the Consul UI running on: `http://localhost:8500`

## Dockerfile-bats-core-windows

This file sole purpose is to build the custom Bats image for Windows OS. To do this, the official [windows/servercore image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore) is used as base image.
To build this image you need to run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
docker build -t bats-verify . -f Dockerfile-bats-windows
```

This is the same command used in run-tests.sh

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --name bats-verify bats-verify
```

If everything works properly you should see the help commands and available parameters about how to run Bats tests like is displayed below

```shell
$ docker run --rm --name bats-verify bats-verify
Usage: bats [OPTIONS] <tests>
       bats [-h | -v]

  <tests> is the path to a Bats test file, or the path to a directory
  containing Bats test files (ending with ".bats")
```

## Dockerfile-consul-dev-windows

The Consul-dev custom image deployed in the "Dockerfile-consul-dev-windows" DockerFile is generated by the sh script of the same name.
When executing it, the compilation of Consul is carried out and it is saved in the _"dist"_ directory, this file is then copied to a container created from the _"windows/consul"_ image.
It is necessary that the _"windows/consul"_ image has been built first.

To build this image you need to run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
./Dockerfile-consul-dev-windows.sh
```

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8300:8300 -p 8301:8301 -p 8302:8302 -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:8600 --name consul-dev --hostname "consul-primary-server" --network-alias "consul-primary-server" windows/consul-dev agent -dev -datacenter "primary" -grpc-port -1 -client "0.0.0.0" -bind "0.0.0.0"
```

If everything works properly you should openning the browser and check the Consul UI running on: `http://localhost:8500`

## Dockerfile-fortio-windows

This file sole purpose is to build the custom Fortio image for Windows OS. To do this, the official [windows/nanoserver image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-nanoserver) is used as base image.
To build this image you need to run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
docker build -t fortio . -f Dockerfile-fortio-windows
```

This is the same command used in run-tests.sh

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --name fortio fortio
```

If everything works properly you should opening the browser and check that the Fortio server running on: `http://localhost:8080/fortio`

## Dockerfile-jaegertracing-windows

The all-in-one image was replaced by a [windows/servercore image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore) image, where we download the official jaegertracing binaries for Windows. Then we replicate everything that is being done in the all-in-one Docker image available for Linux.
To build this image you need to run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
docker build -t jaegertracing -f Dockerfile-jaegertracing-windows .
```

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --name jaegertracing version
```

If everything works properly you should get the following output:

```shell
{"gitCommit":"b5e2b65c690c3b4ed55e91f1afe1efb0570dc542","GitVersion":"v1.11.0","BuildDate":"2019-03-07T12:56:46Z"}
```

## Dockerfile-socat-windows

The alpine:socat image was replaced by a windows core image to which a precompiled version of Socat was installed.

The windows base used was: `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809`

The compiled windows version of Socat can be found in the repository [https://github.com/tech128/socat-1.7.3.0-windows](https://github.com/tech128/socat-1.7.3.0-windows)

To build this image you need to run the following command on your terminal:

```shell
docker build -t socat -f Dockerfile-socat-windows .
```

You can test the built file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm --name socat socat
```

If everything works properly you should get the following output:

```shell
20XX/XX/XX XX:XX:XX socat[1292] E exactly 2 addresses required (there are 0); use option "-h" for help
```

## Build images

To build the images, it is necessary to open a Git bash terminal and run

```shell
./build-images.sh
```

# Testing

During development, it may be more convenient to check your work-in-progress by running only the tests which you expect to be affected by your changes, as the full test suite can take several minutes to execute. [Go's built-in test tool](https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/go/internal/test/) allows specifying a list of packages to test and the `-run` option to only include test names matching a regular expression.
The `go test -short` flag can also be used to skip slower tests.

Examples (run from the repository root):

- `go test -v ./connect` will run all tests in the connect package (see `./connect` folder)
- `go test -v -run TestRetryJoin ./command/agent` will run all tests in the agent package (see `./command/agent` folder) with name substring `TestRetryJoin`

When a pull request is opened CI will run all tests and lint to verify the change.

If you want to run the tests on Windows images you must attach the win=true flag.

Example:

```shell
go test -v -timeout=30m -tags integration ./test/integration/connect/envoy -run="TestEnvoy/case-badauthz" -win=true
```
