# due to this workflow only running a git diff check and not building or publishing anything,
# there is no harm in checking out the PR HEAD code.
#
# All the code checked out in this workflow should be considered untrusted. This workflow must
# never call any makefiles or scripts. It must never be changed to run any code from the checkout.
