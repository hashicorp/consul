# The outline of this workflow is something that the GitHub Security team warns against
# here: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests. But
# due to this workflow only running a git diff check and not building or publishing anything,
# there is no harm in checking out the PR HEAD code.
#
# All the code checked out in this workflow should be considered untrusted. This workflow must
# never call any makefiles or scripts. It must never be changed to run any code from the checkout.

# This workflow posts a message to a PR to remind maintainers that there are website/ changes
# in the PR and if they need to be cherry-picked to the stable-website branch, the
# 'type/docs-cherrypick' label needs to be applied.
