        # In the future, we can transition from .go-version and goenv to
        # Go 1.21 `toolchain` directives by updating this workflow rather
        # than individually setting `go-version-file` in each `setup-go`
        # job (as of 2024-01-03, `setup-go` does not support `toolchain`).
        #
        # When changing the method of Go version detection, also update
        # GOLANG_VERSION detection in the root Makefile; this is used for
        # setting the Dockerfile Go version.
