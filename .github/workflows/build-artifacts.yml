  # This is job is required for branch protection as a required gihub check
  # because GitHub actions show up as checks at the job level and not the
  # workflow level.  This is currently a feature request:
  # https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/12395
  #
  # This job must:
  # - be placed after the fanout of a workflow so that everything fans back in
  #   to this job.
  # - "need" any job that is part of the fan out / fan in
  # - implement the if logic because we have conditional jobs 
  #   (go-test-enteprise) that this job needs and this would potentially get 
  #   skipped if a previous job got skipped.  So we use the if clause to make 
  # sure it does not get skipped.
