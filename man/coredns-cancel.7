.SH CANCEL
.SH NAME
.PP
\fIcancel\fP - a plugin that cancels a request's context after 5001 milliseconds.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIcancel\fP plugin creates a canceling context for each request. It adds a timeout that gets
triggered after 5001 milliseconds.

.PP
The 5001 number is chosen because the default timeout for DNS clients is 5 seconds, after that they
give up.

.PP
A plugin interested in the cancellation status should call \fB\fCplugin.Done()\fR on the context. If the
context was canceled due to a timeout the plugin should not write anything back to the client and
return a value indicating CoreDNS should not either; a zero return value should suffice for that.
