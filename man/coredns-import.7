.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIimport\fP - includes files or references snippets from a Corefile.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIimport\fP plugin can be used to include files into the main configuration. Another use is to
reference predefined snippets. Both can help to avoid some duplication.

.PP
This is a unique plugin in that \fIimport\fP can appear outside of a server block. In other words, it
can appear at the top of a Corefile where an address would normally be.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
.RS

.nf
import PATTERN

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBPATTERN\fP is the file, glob pattern (\fB\fC*\fR) or snippet to include. Its contents will replace
this line, as if that file's contents appeared here to begin with.


.SH "FILES"
.PP
You can use \fIimport\fP to include a file or files. This file's location is relative to the
Corefile's location. It is an error if a specific file cannot be found, but an empty glob pattern is
not an error.

.SH "SNIPPETS"
.PP
You can define snippets to be reused later in your Corefile by defining a block with a single-token
label surrounded by parentheses:

.PP
.RS

.nf
(mysnippet) {
    ...
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Then you can invoke the snippet with \fIimport\fP:

.PP
.RS

.nf
import mysnippet

.fi
.RE

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Import a shared configuration:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
   import config/common.conf
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Where \fB\fCconfig/common.conf\fR contains:

.PP
.RS

.nf
prometheus
errors
log

.fi
.RE

.PP
This imports files found in the zones directory:

.PP
.RS

.nf
import ../zones/*

.fi
.RE

.SH "ALSO SEE"
.PP
See corefile(5).
