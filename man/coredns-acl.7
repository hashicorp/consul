.PP
\fIacl\fP - enforces access control policies on source ip and prevents unauthorized access to DNS servers.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
With \fB\fCacl\fR enabled, users are able to block suspicious DNS queries by configuring IP filter rule sets, i.e. allowing authorized queries to recurse or blocking unauthorized queries.

.PP
This plugin can be used multiple times per Server Block.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
.RS

.nf
acl [ZONES...] {
    ACTION [type QTYPE...] [net SOURCE...]
}

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBZONES\fP zones it should be authoritative for. If empty, the zones from the configuration block are used.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBACTION\fP (\fIallow\fP or \fIblock\fP) defines the way to deal with DNS queries matched by this rule. The default action is \fIallow\fP, which means a DNS query not matched by any rules will be allowed to recurse.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBQTYPE\fP is the query type to match for the requests to be allowed or blocked. Common resource record types are supported. \fB\fC*\fR stands for all record types. The default behavior for an omitted \fB\fCtype QTYPE...\fR is to match all kinds of DNS queries (same as \fB\fCtype *\fR).
.IP \(bu 4
\fBSOURCE\fP is the source IP address to match for the requests to be allowed or blocked. Typical CIDR notation and single IP address are supported. \fB\fC*\fR stands for all possible source IP addresses.

    }

        allow net 192.168.1.0/24
        block net 192.168.0.0/16
