.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIdnssec\fP - enables on-the-fly DNSSEC signing of served data.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
With \fIdnssec\fP, any reply that doesn't (or can't) do DNSSEC will get signed on the fly. Authenticated
denial of existence is implemented with NSEC black lies. Using ECDSA as an algorithm is preferred as
this leads to smaller signatures (compared to RSA). NSEC3 is \fInot\fP supported.

.PP
This plugin can only be used once per Server Block.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
.RS

.nf
dnssec [ZONES... ] {
    key file KEY...
    cache\_capacity CAPACITY
}

.PP
The signing behavior depends on the keys specified. If multiple keys are specified of which there is
at least one key with the SEP bit set and at least one key with the SEP bit unset, signing will happen
in split ZSK/KSK mode. DNSKEY records will be signed with all keys that have the SEP bit set. All other
records will be signed with all keys that do not have the SEP bit set.

.PP
In any other case, each specified key will be treated as a CSK (common signing key), forgoing the
ZSK/KSK split. All signing operations are done online.
Authenticated denial of existence is implemented with NSEC black lies. Using ECDSA as an algorithm
is preferred as this leads to smaller signatures (compared to RSA). NSEC3 is \fInot\fP supported.

.PP
If multiple \fIdnssec\fP plugins are specified in the same zone, the last one specified will be
used (See bugs
\[la]#bugs\[ra]).

.IP \(bu 4
\fBZONES\fP zones that should be signed. If empty, the zones from the configuration block
are used.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCkey file\fR indicates that \fBKEY\fP file(s) should be read from disk. When multiple keys are specified, RRsets
will be signed with all keys. Generating a key can be done with \fB\fCdnssec-keygen\fR: \fB\fCdnssec-keygen -a
ECDSAP256SHA256 <zonename>\fR. A key created for zone \fIA\fP can be safely used for zone \fIB\fP. The name of the
key file can be specified in one of the following formats

.RS
.IP \(en 4
basename of the generated key \fB\fCKexample.org+013+45330\fR
.IP \(en 4
generated public key \fB\fCKexample.org+013+45330.key\fR
.IP \(en 4
generated private key \fB\fCKexample.org+013+45330.private\fR

.RE
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcache_capacity\fR indicates the capacity of the cache. The dnssec plugin uses a cache to store
RRSIGs. The default for \fBCAPACITY\fP is 10000.


.SH "METRICS"
.PP
If monitoring is enabled (via the \fIprometheus\fP plugin) then the following metrics are exported:

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_dnssec_cache_size{server, type}\fR - total elements in the cache, type is "signature".
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_dnssec_cache_hits_total{server}\fR - Counter of cache hits.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_dnssec_cache_misses_total{server}\fR - Counter of cache misses.


.PP
The label \fB\fCserver\fR indicated the server handling the request, see the \fImetrics\fP plugin for details.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Sign responses for \fB\fCexample.org\fR with the key "Kexample.org.+013+45330.key".

.RS

.nf

        key file Kexample.org.+013+45330

Sign responses for a kubernetes zone with the key "Kcluster.local+013+45129.key".
