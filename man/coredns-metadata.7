.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fImetadata\fP - enable a meta data collector.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
By enabling \fImetadata\fP any plugin that implements metadata.Provider
interface
\[la]https://godoc.org/github.com/coredns/coredns/plugin/metadata#Provider\[ra] will be called for
each DNS query, at beginning of the process for that query, in order to add its own meta data to
context.

.PP
The meta data collected will be available for all plugins, via the Context parameter provided in the
ServeDNS function. The package (code) documentation has examples on how to inspect and retrieve
metadata a plugin might be interested in.

.PP
The meta data is added by setting a label with a value in the context. These labels should be named
\fB\fCplugin/NAME\fR, where \fBNAME\fP is something descriptive. The only hard requirement the \fImetadata\fP
plugin enforces is that the labels contains a slash. See the documentation for
\fB\fCmetadata.SetValueFunc\fR.

.PP
The value stored is a string. The empty string signals "no meta data". See the documentation for
\fB\fCmetadata.ValueFunc\fR on how to retrieve this.

.SH "SYNTAX"

\fBZONES\fP zones metadata should be invoked for.


.SH "PLUGINS"
.PP
\fB\fCmetadata.Provider\fR interface needs to be implemented by each plugin willing to provide metadata
information for other plugins. It will be called by metadata and gather the information from all
plugins in context.

.PP
Note: this method should work quickly, because it is called for every request.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The \fIrewrite\fP plugin uses meta data to rewrite requests.
