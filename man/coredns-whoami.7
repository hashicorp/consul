.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIwhoami\fP - returns your resolver's local IP address, port and transport.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIwhoami\fP plugin is not really that useful, but can be used for having a simple (fast) endpoint
to test clients against. When \fIwhoami\fP returns a response it will have your client's IP address in
the additional section as either an A or AAAA record.

.PP
The reply always has an empty answer section. The port and transport are included in the additional
section as a SRV record, transport can be "tcp" or "udp".

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&.\_<transport>.qname. 0 IN SRV 0 0 <port> .

.fi
.RE

.PP
The \fIwhoami\fP plugin will respond to every A or AAAA query, regardless of the query name.

.PP
If CoreDNS can't find a Corefile on startup this is the \fIdefault\fP plugin that gets loaded. As such
it can be used to check that CoreDNS is responding to queries. Other than that this plugin is of
limited use in production.
