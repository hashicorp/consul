.SH NAME
.PP
\fIfile\fP - enables serving zone data from an RFC 1035-style master file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The file plugin is used for an "old-style" DNS server. It serves from a preloaded file that exists
on disk. If the zone file contains signatures (i.e., is signed using DNSSEC), correct DNSSEC answers
are returned. Only NSEC is supported! If you use this setup \fIyou\fP are responsible for re-signing the
zonefile.

.SH SYNTAX
.PP
.RS

.nf
file DBFILE [ZONES...]

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBDBFILE\fP the database file to read and parse. If the path is relative, the path from the \fIroot\fP
directive will be prepended to it.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBZONES\fP zones it should be authoritative for. If empty, the zones from the configuration block
are used.


.PP
If you want to round-robin A and AAAA responses look at the \fIloadbalance\fP plugin.

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCtransfer\fR enables zone transfers. It may be specified multiples times. \fB\fCTo\fR or \fB\fCfrom\fR signals
the direction. \fBADDRESS\fP must be denoted in CIDR notation (e.g., 127.0.0.1/32) or just as plain
addresses. The special wildcard \fB\fC*\fR means: the entire internet (only valid for 'transfer to').
When an address is specified a notify message will be send whenever the zone is reloaded.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCreload\fR interval to perform a reload of the zone if the SOA version changes. Default is one minute.
Value of \fB\fC0\fR means to not scan for changes and reload. For example, \fB\fC30s\fR checks the zonefile every 30 seconds
and reloads the zone when serial changes.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCupstream\fR resolve external names found (think CNAMEs) pointing to external names. This is only
really useful when CoreDNS is configured as a proxy; for normal authoritative serving you don't
need \fIor\fP want to use this. CoreDNS will resolve CNAMEs against itself.


.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Load the \fB\fCexample.org\fR zone from \fB\fCexample.org.signed\fR and allow transfers to the internet, but send
notifies to 10.240.1.1

.PP
.RS

.nf
example.org {
    file example.org.signed {
        transfer to *
        transfer to 10.240.1.1
    }
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Or use a single zone file for multiple zones:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    file example.org.signed example.org example.net {
        transfer to *
        transfer to 10.240.1.1
    }
}
