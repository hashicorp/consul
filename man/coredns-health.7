.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIhealth\fP - enables a health check endpoint.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Enabled process wide health endpoint. When CoreDNS is up and running this returns a 200 OK HTTP
status code. The health is exported, by default, on port 8080/health .

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
.RS

.nf
health [ADDRESS]

.fi
.RE

.PP
Optionally takes an address; the default is \fB\fC:8080\fR. The health path is fixed to \fB\fC/health\fR. The
health endpoint returns a 200 response code and the word "OK" when this server is healthy.

.PP
An extra option can be set with this extended syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
health [ADDRESS] {
    lameduck DURATION
}

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
Where \fB\fClameduck\fR will make the process unhealthy then \fIwait\fP for \fBDURATION\fP before the process
shuts down.


.PP
If you have multiple Server Blocks, \fIhealth\fP can only be enabled in one of them (as it is process
wide). If you really need multiple endpoints, you must run health endpoints on different ports:

.PP
.RS

.nf
com {
    whoami
    health :8080
}

net {
    erratic
    health :8081
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Doing this is supported but both endpoints ":8080" and ":8081" will export the exact same health.

.SH "METRICS"
.PP
If monitoring is enabled (via the \fIprometheus\fP plugin) then the following metric is exported:

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_health_request_duration_seconds{}\fR - duration to process a HTTP query to the local
\fB\fC/health\fR endpoint. As this a local operation it should be fast. A (large) increase in this
duration indicates the CoreDNS process is having trouble keeping up with its query load.


.PP
Note that this metric \fIdoes not\fP have a \fB\fCserver\fR label, because being overloaded is a symptom of
the running process, \fInot\fP a specific server.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Run another health endpoint on http://localhost:8091
\[la]http://localhost:8091\[ra].

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    health localhost:8091
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Set a lameduck duration of 1 second:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    health localhost:8092 {
        lameduck 1s
    }
}

.fi
