.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIetcd\fP - enables SkyDNS service discovery from etcd.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIetcd\fP plugin implements the (older) SkyDNS service discovery service. It is \fInot\fP suitable as
a generic DNS zone data plugin. Only a subset of DNS record types are implemented, and subdomains
and delegations are not handled at all.

.PP
The data in the etcd instance has to be encoded as
a message
\[la]https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns/blob/2fcff74cdc9f9a7dd64189a447ef27ac354b725f/msg/service.go#L26\[ra]
like SkyDNS
\[la]https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns\[ra]. It works just like SkyDNS.

.PP
The etcd plugin makes extensive use of the \fIforward\fP plugin to forward and query other servers in the
network.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
.RS

.nf
etcd [ZONES...]

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBZONES\fP zones \fIetcd\fP should be authoritative for.


.PP
The path will default to \fB\fC/skydns\fR the local etcd3 proxy (http://localhost:2379
\[la]http://localhost:2379\[ra]). If no zones are
specified the block's zone will be used as the zone.

.PP
If you want to \fB\fCround robin\fR A and AAAA responses look at the \fB\fCloadbalance\fR plugin.

.PP
.RS

.nf
etcd [ZONES...] {
    fallthrough [ZONES...]
    path PATH
    endpoint ENDPOINT...
    credentials USERNAME PASSWORD
    tls CERT KEY CACERT
}

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCfallthrough\fR If zone matches but no record can be generated, pass request to the next plugin.
If \fB[ZONES...]\fP is omitted, then fallthrough happens for all zones for which the plugin
is authoritative. If specific zones are listed (for example \fB\fCin-addr.arpa\fR and \fB\fCip6.arpa\fR), then only
queries for those zones will be subject to fallthrough.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBPATH\fP the path inside etcd. Defaults to "/skydns".
.IP \(bu 4
\fBENDPOINT\fP the etcd endpoints. Defaults to "http://localhost:2379"
\[la]http://localhost:2379"\[ra].
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcredentials\fR is used to set the \fBUSERNAME\fP and \fBPASSWORD\fP for accessing the etcd cluster.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCtls\fR followed by:

.RS
.IP \(en 4
no arguments, if the server certificate is signed by a system-installed CA and no client cert is needed
.IP \(en 4
a single argument that is the CA PEM file, if the server cert is not signed by a system CA and no client cert is needed
.IP \(en 4
two arguments - path to cert PEM file, the path to private key PEM file - if the server certificate is signed by a system-installed CA and a client certificate is needed
.IP \(en 4
three arguments - path to cert PEM file, path to client private key PEM file, path to CA PEM
file - if the server certificate is not signed by a system-installed CA and client certificate
is needed.

.SH "SPECIAL BEHAVIOUR"
.PP
The \fIetcd\fP plugin leverages directory structure to look for related entries. For example
an entry \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx\fR would have entries like \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx/a\fR,
\fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx/b\fR and so on. Similarly a directory \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx1\fR will have all
\fB\fCmx1\fR entries.

.PP
With etcd3, support for hierarchical keys are
dropped
\[la]https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/learning/api.html\[ra]. This means there are no directories
but only flat keys with prefixes in etcd3. To accommodate lookups, etcdv3 plugin now does a lookup
on prefix \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx/\fR to search for entries like \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx/a\fR etc, and
if there is nothing found on \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx/\fR, it looks for \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx\fR to
find entries like \fB\fC/skydns/test/skydns/mx1\fR.

.PP
This causes two lookups from CoreDNS to etcdv3 in certain cases.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
This is the default SkyDNS setup, with everything specified in full:

.PP
.RS

.nf
skydns.local {
    etcd {
        path /skydns
        endpoint http://localhost:2379
    }
    prometheus
    cache
    loadbalance
}

\&. {
    forward . 8.8.8.8:53 8.8.4.4:53
    cache
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Or a setup where we use \fB\fC/etc/resolv.conf\fR as the basis for the proxy and the upstream
when resolving external pointing CNAMEs.

.PP
.RS

.nf
skydns.local {
    etcd {
        path /skydns
    }
    cache
}

\&. {
    forward . /etc/resolv.conf
    cache
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Multiple endpoints are supported as well.

.PP
.RS

.nf
etcd skydns.local {
    endpoint http://localhost:2379 http://localhost:4001
\&...

.fi
.RE

.PP
Before getting started with these examples, please setup \fB\fCetcdctl\fR (with \fB\fCetcdv3\fR API) as explained
here
\[la]https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/dev-guide/interacting_v3.html\[ra]. This will help you to put
sample keys in your etcd server.

.PP
If you prefer, you can use \fB\fCcurl\fR to populate the \fB\fCetcd\fR server, but with \fB\fCcurl\fR the
endpoint URL depends on the version of \fB\fCetcd\fR. For instance, \fB\fCetcd v3.2\fR or before uses only
[CLIENT-URL]/v3alpha/* while \fB\fCetcd v3.5\fR or later uses [CLIENT-URL]/v3/* . Also, Key and Value must
be base64 encoded in the JSON payload. With \fB\fCetcdctl\fR these details are automatically taken care
of. You can check this document
\[la]https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway.md#notes\[ra]
for details.

.SS "REVERSE ZONES"
.PP
Reverse zones are supported. You need to make CoreDNS aware of the fact that you are also
authoritative for the reverse. For instance if you want to add the reverse for 10.0.0.0/24, you'll
need to add the zone \fB\fC0.0.10.in-addr.arpa\fR to the list of zones. Showing a snippet of a Corefile:

.PP
.RS

.nf
etcd skydns.local 10.0.0.0/24 {
\&...

.fi
.RE

.PP
Next you'll need to populate the zone with reverse records, here we add a reverse for
10.0.0.127 pointing to reverse.skydns.local.

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/arpa/in\-addr/10/0/0/127 '{"host":"reverse.skydns.local."}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
Querying with dig:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig @localhost \-x 10.0.0.127 +short
reverse.skydns.local.

.fi
.RE

.SS "ZONE NAME AS A RECORD"
.PP
The zone name itself can be used as an \fB\fCA\fR record. This behavior can be achieved by writing special
entries to the ETCD path of your zone. If your zone is named \fB\fCskydns.local\fR for example, you can
create an \fB\fCA\fR record for this zone as follows:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/ '{"host":"1.1.1.1","ttl":60}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you query the zone name itself, you will receive the created \fB\fCA\fR record:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig +short skydns.local @localhost
1.1.1.1

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you would like to use DNS RR for the zone name, you can set the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x1 '{"host":"1.1.1.1","ttl":60}'
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x2 '{"host":"1.1.1.2","ttl":60}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you query the zone name now, you will get the following response:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig +short skydns.local @localhost
1.1.1.1
1.1.1.2

.fi
.RE

.SS "ZONE NAME AS AAAA RECORD"
.PP
If you would like to use \fB\fCAAAA\fR records for the zone name too, you can set the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x3 '{"host":"2003::8:1","ttl":60}'
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x4 '{"host":"2003::8:2","ttl":60}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you query the zone name for \fB\fCAAAA\fR now, you will get the following response:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig +short skydns.local AAAA @localhost
2003::8:1
2003::8:2

.fi
.RE

.SS "SRV RECORD"
.PP
If you would like to use \fB\fCSRV\fR records, you can set the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x5 '{"host":"skydns\-local.server","ttl":60,"priority":10,"port":8080}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
Please notice that the key \fB\fChost\fR is the \fB\fCtarget\fR in \fB\fCSRV\fR, so it should be a domain name.

.PP
If you query the zone name for \fB\fCSRV\fR now, you will get the following response:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig +short skydns.local SRV @localhost
10 100 8080 skydns\-local.server.

.fi
.RE

.SS "TXT RECORD"
.PP
If you would like to use \fB\fCTXT\fR records, you can set the following:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% etcdctl put /skydns/local/skydns/x6 '{"ttl":60,"text":"this is a random text message."}'

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you query the zone name for \fB\fCTXT\fR now, you will get the following response:

.PP
.RS

.nf
% dig +short skydns.local TXT @localhost
"this is a random text message."
