.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIgrpc\fP - facilitates proxying DNS messages to upstream resolvers via gRPC protocol.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIgrpc\fP plugin supports gRPC and TLS.

.PP
This plugin can only be used once per Server Block.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
In its most basic form:

.PP
.RS

.nf
grpc FROM TO...

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBFROM\fP is the base domain to match for the request to be proxied.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBTO...\fP are the destination endpoints to proxy to. The number of upstreams is
limited to 15.


.PP
Multiple upstreams are randomized (see \fB\fCpolicy\fR) on first use. When a proxy returns an error
the next upstream in the list is tried.

.PP
Extra knobs are available with an expanded syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf
grpc FROM TO... {
    except IGNORED\_NAMES...
    tls CERT KEY CA
    tls\_servername NAME
    policy random|round\_robin|sequential
}

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBFROM\fP and \fBTO...\fP as above.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBIGNORED_NAMES\fP in \fB\fCexcept\fR is a space-separated list of domains to exclude from proxying.
Requests that match none of these names will be passed through.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCtls\fR \fBCERT\fP \fBKEY\fP \fBCA\fP define the TLS properties for TLS connection. From 0 to 3 arguments can be
provided with the meaning as described below

.RS
.IP \(en 4
\fB\fCtls\fR - no client authentication is used, and the system CAs are used to verify the server certificate
.IP \(en 4
\fB\fCtls\fR \fBCA\fP - no client authentication is used, and the file CA is used to verify the server certificate
.IP \(en 4
\fB\fCtls\fR \fBCERT\fP \fBKEY\fP - client authentication is used with the specified cert/key pair.
The server certificate is verified with the system CAs
.IP \(en 4
\fB\fCtls\fR \fBCERT\fP \fBKEY\fP  \fBCA\fP - client authentication is used with the specified cert/key pair.
The server certificate is verified using the specified CA file

.RE
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCtls_servername\fR \fBNAME\fP allows you to set a server name in the TLS configuration; for instance 9.9.9.9
needs this to be set to \fB\fCdns.quad9.net\fR. Multiple upstreams are still allowed in this scenario,
but they have to use the same \fB\fCtls_servername\fR. E.g. mixing 9.9.9.9 (QuadDNS) with 1.1.1.1
(Cloudflare) will not work.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCpolicy\fR specifies the policy to use for selecting upstream servers. The default is \fB\fCrandom\fR.


.PP
Also note the TLS config is "global" for the whole grpc proxy if you need a different
\fB\fCtls-name\fR for different upstreams you're out of luck.

.SH "METRICS"
.PP
If monitoring is enabled (via the \fIprometheus\fP plugin) then the following metric are exported:

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_grpc_request_duration_seconds{to}\fR - duration per upstream interaction.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_grpc_request_count_total{to}\fR - query count per upstream.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_grpc_response_rcode_count_total{to, rcode}\fR - count of RCODEs per upstream.
and we are randomly (this always uses the \fB\fCrandom\fR policy) spraying to an upstream.


.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Proxy all requests within \fB\fCexample.org.\fR to a nameserver running on a different port:

.PP
.RS

.nf
example.org {
    grpc . 127.0.0.1:9005
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Load balance all requests between three resolvers, one of which has a IPv6 address.

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    grpc . 10.0.0.10:53 10.0.0.11:1053 [2003::1]:53
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Forward everything except requests to \fB\fCexample.org\fR

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    grpc . 10.0.0.10:1234 {
        except example.org
    }
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Proxy everything except \fB\fCexample.org\fR using the host's \fB\fCresolv.conf\fR's nameservers:

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    grpc . /etc/resolv.conf {
        except example.org
    }
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Proxy all requests to 9.9.9.9 using the TLS protocol, and cache every answer for up to 30
seconds. Note the \fB\fCtls_servername\fR is mandatory if you want a working setup, as 9.9.9.9 can't be
used in the TLS negotiation.

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    grpc . 9.9.9.9 {
       tls\_servername dns.quad9.net
    }
    cache 30
}

.fi
.RE

.PP
Or with multiple upstreams from the same provider

.PP
.RS

.nf
\&. {
    grpc . 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 {
       tls\_servername cloudflare\-dns.com
    }
    cache 30
}

.fi
.RE

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The TLS config is global for the whole grpc proxy if you need a different \fB\fCtls_servername\fR for
different upstreams you're out of luck.
