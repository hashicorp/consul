# Vagrant Consul Demo

This demo provides a very simple `Vagrantfile` that creates two Consul
server nodes, one at *172.20.20.10* and another at *172.20.20.11*. Both are
running a standard Debian * distribution, and *the latest version* of Consul
is pre-installed.

To get started, you can start the nodes by just doing:

```
vagrant up
```

> NOTE: If you prefer a different Vagrant box, you can set the `DEMO_BOX_NAME`
> environment variable before starting `vagrant` like this: 
> `DEMO_BOX_NAME="ubuntu/xenial64" vagrant up`

Once it is finished, you should be able to see the following:

```
vagrant status
Current machine states:

n1                        running (virtualbox)
n2                        running (virtualbox)
```

At this point the two nodes are running and you can SSH in to play with them:

```
vagrant ssh n1
consul version
Consul v0.7.5
Protocol 2 spoken by default, understands 2 to 3 (agent will automatically use protocol >2 when speaking to compatible agents)
exit
```

and

```
vagrant ssh n2
consul version
Consul v0.7.5
Protocol 2 spoken by default, understands 2 to 3 (agent will automatically use protocol >2 when speaking to compatible agents)
exit
```

> NOTE: This demo will query the HashiCorp Checkpoint service to determine
> the latest Consul release version and install that version by default,
> but if you need a different Consul version, set the `CONSUL_DEMO_VERSION`
> environment variable before `vagrant up` like this:
> `CONSUL_DEMO_VERSION=0.6.4 vagrant up`
