# These scan results are run as part of CRT workflows.

# Un-triaged results will block release. See `security-scanner` docs for more
# information on how to add `triage` config to unblock releases for specific results.
# In most cases, we should not need to disable the entire scanner to unblock a release.

# To run manually, install scanner and then from the repository root run
# `SECURITY_SCANNER_CONFIG_FILE=.release/security-scan.hcl scan ...`
# To scan a local container, add `local_daemon = true` to the `container` block below.
# See `security-scanner` docs or run with `--help` for scan target syntax.
