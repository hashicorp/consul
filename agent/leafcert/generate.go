// caChangeJitterWindow is the time over which we spread each round of retries
// when attempting to get a new certificate following a root rotation. It's
// selected to be a trade-off between not making rotation unnecessarily slow on
// a tiny cluster while not hammering the servers on a huge cluster
// unnecessarily hard. Servers rate limit to protect themselves from the
// expensive crypto work, but in practice have 10k+ RPCs all in the same second
// will cause a major disruption even on large servers due to downloading the
// payloads, parsing msgpack etc. Instead we pick a window that for now is fixed
// but later might be either user configurable (not nice since it would become
// another hard-to-tune value) or set dynamically by the server based on it's
// knowledge of how many certs need to be rotated. Currently the server doesn't
// know that so we pick something that is reasonable. We err on the side of
// being slower that we need in trivial cases but gentler for large deployments.
// 30s means that even with a cluster of 10k service instances, the server only
// has to cope with ~333 RPCs a second which shouldn't be too bad if it's rate
// limiting the actual expensive crypto work.
//
// The actual backoff strategy when we are rate limited is to have each cert
// only retry once with each window of this size, at a point in the window
// selected at random. This performs much better than exponential backoff in
// terms of getting things rotated quickly with more predictable load and so
// fewer rate limited requests. See the full simulation this is based on at
// https://github.com/banks/sim-rate-limit-backoff/blob/master/README.md for
// more detail.
