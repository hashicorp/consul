// eventBuffer is a single-writer, multiple-reader, unlimited length concurrent
// buffer of events that have been published on a topic. The buffer is
// effectively just the head of an atomically updated single-linked list. Atomic
// accesses are usually to be suspected as premature optimization but this
// specific design has several important features that significantly simplify a
// lot of our PubSub machinery.
//
// The eventBuffer only tracks the most recent set of published events, so
// if there are no consumers, older events are automatically garbage collected.
// Consumers are notified of new events by closing a channel on the previous head
// allowing efficient broadcast to many watchers without having to run multiple
// goroutines or deliver to O(N) separate channels.
//
// Because eventBuffer is a linked list with atomically updated pointers, readers don't
// have to take a lock and can consume at their own pace. We also don't need a
// fixed limit on the number of items, which avoids needing to configure
// buffer length to balance wasting memory, against being able to tolerate
// occasionally slow readers.
//
// The buffer is used to deliver all messages broadcast to a topic for active
// subscribers to consume, but it is also an effective way to both deliver and
// optionally cache snapshots per topic and key. By using an eventBuffer,
// snapshot functions don't have to read the whole snapshot into memory before
// delivery - they can stream from memdb. However simply by storing a pointer to
// the first event in the buffer, we can cache the buffered events for future
// watchers on the same topic. Finally, once we've delivered all the snapshot
// events to the buffer, we can append a next-element which is the first topic
// buffer element with a higher index and so consumers can keep reading the
// same buffer to have subsequent updates streamed after the snapshot is read.
//
// A huge benefit here is that caching snapshots becomes very simple - we don't
// have to do any additional book-keeping to figure out when to truncate the
// topic buffer to make sure the snapshot is still usable or run into issues
// where the cached snapshot is no longer useful since the buffer will keep
// elements around only as long as either the cache or a subscriber need them.
// So we can use whatever simple timeout logic we like to decide how long to
// keep caches (or if we should keep them at all) and the buffers will
// automatically keep the events we need to make that work for exactly the
// optimal amount of time and no longer.
//
// A new buffer is constructed with a sentinel "empty" bufferItem that has a nil
// Events array. This enables subscribers to start watching for the next update
// immediately.
//
// The zero value eventBuffer is _not_ usable, as it has not been
// initialized with an empty bufferItem so can not be used to wait for the first
// published event. Call newEventBuffer to construct a new buffer.
//
// Calls to Append or AppendBuffer that mutate the head must be externally
// synchronized. This allows systems that already serialize writes to append
// without lock overhead (e.g. a snapshot goroutine appending thousands of
// events).

// finally by linked to the topic buffer for the subsequent events so
// subscribers can seamlessly consume the updates. Note that Events in item must
// already be fully populated with ACL rules and must not be mutated further as
