// Notify registers a desire to be updated about changes to a cache result.
//
// It is a helper that abstracts code from performing their own "blocking" query
// logic against a cache key to watch for changes and to maintain the key in
// cache actively. It will continue to perform blocking Get requests until the
// context is canceled.
//
// The passed context must be canceled or timeout in order to free resources
// and stop maintaining the value in cache. Typically request-scoped resources
// do this but if a long-lived context like context.Background is used, then the
// caller must arrange for it to be canceled when the watch is no longer
// needed.
//
// The passed chan may be buffered or unbuffered, if the caller doesn't consume
// fast enough it will block the notification loop. When the chan is later
// drained, watching resumes correctly. If the pause is longer than the
// cachetype's TTL, the result might be removed from the local cache. Even in
// this case though when the chan is drained again, the new Get will re-fetch
// the entry from servers and resume notification behavior transparently.
//
// The chan is passed in to allow multiple cached results to be watched by a
// single consumer without juggling extra goroutines per watch. The
// correlationID is opaque and will be returned in all UpdateEvents generated by
// result of watching the specified request so the caller can set this to any
// value that allows them to disambiguate between events in the returned chan
// when sharing a chan between multiple cache entries. If the chan is closed,
// the notify loop will terminate.

		// that the data is not older than the MaxAge. Therefore after fetching the data from
		// the cache we can sleep until the age of that data would exceed the MaxAge. Sometimes
		// this will be for the MaxAge duration (like when only a single notify was executed so
		// only 1 go routine is keeping the cache updated). Other times this will be some smaller
		// duration than MaxAge (when multiple notify calls were executed and this go routine just
		// got data back from the cache that was a cache hit after the other go routine fetched it
		// without a hit). We cannot just set MustRevalidate on the request and always sleep for MaxAge
