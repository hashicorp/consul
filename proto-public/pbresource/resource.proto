// [monotonic reads](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/monotonic-reads).
//
// That is, a read will always return results that are as up-to-date as an
// earlier read, provided both happen on the same Consul server. But we do
// not make any such guarantee about writes. In other words, reads won't
// necessarily reflect earlier writes, even when made against the same server.
//
// This guarantee also holds between the Read and WatchList endpoints such that
// you'll never receive an event about a resource that you cannot immediately
// read, provided both the Read and WatchList happen on the same server.
//
// The Read endpoint also supports a strong consistency mode that guarantees
// [linearizability](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable), such
// that a read will always return the most up-to-date version of a resource,
// without caveat.
//
// This is much more expensive than eventual consistency and when using the Raft
// storage backend, will increase load on the cluster leader, so should be used
// sparingly.

// gRPC metadata field to "consistent".
