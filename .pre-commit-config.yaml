#
# Guidelines for adding new pre-commit hooks
# ====================================================================
# A hook SHOULD be blazingly fast (<2s) to impose minimal latency on
# developer workflows (e.g. golangci-lint takes > 8s)
#
# A hook SHOULD attempt to fix errors, not just identify them.
#
# A hook SHOULD address common errors in files that tend to change
# frequently. While surfacing esoteric issues is nice, hooks that have a
# wider impact are preferred.
