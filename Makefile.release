# Makefile for releasing CoreDNS
#
# The release is controlled from coremain/version.go. The version found
# there is used to tag the git repo and to build the assets that are
# uploaded to github (after some sanity checks).
#
# The release should be accompanied by release notes published on
# blog.coredns.io. For example:
# https://blog.coredns.io/2016/09/18/coredns-001-release/
#
# We use https://github.com/progrium/gh-release to automate github stuff
# be sure to have that binary in your path.
#
# Get a list of authors for this release with:
#
# git log --pretty=format:'%an' v001..master | sort -u
# (where v001 is the previous release, obviously you'll need to adjust this)
#
# Side note: check if MAINTAINERS need an update with `git shortlog -s -n` and see if
# someone has more than 5 (arbitrary number).
#
# Steps:
# * Get an access token: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
# * export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
# * Up the version in coremain/version.go
# * Run: make -f Makefile.release
#   * will commit your change with 'Release $VERSION'
#   * push to github
#   * build the release and do all that fluff.
#
# Steps for docker
# * Login into docker: docker login (should have push creds for coredns registry)
# * Run: make -f Makefile.release docker
# 
# Docker push should happen after you make the new release and uploaded it to Github.
