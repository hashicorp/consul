```release-note:improvement
ui: resolved multiple Ember deprecations:
- Removed mutation-after-consumption warnings in Outlet by staging state updates outside the render pass
- Replaced deprecated Route#replaceWith/transitionTo usage with RouterService in affected routes
- Avoided mutating objects produced by {{hash}} (setting-on-hash) by switching to tracked POJOs
