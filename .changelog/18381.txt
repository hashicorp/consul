```release-note:improvement
checks: It is now possible to configure agent TCP checks to use TLS with
optional server SNI and mutual authentication. To use TLS with a TCP check, the
check must enable the `tcp_use_tls` boolean. By default the agent will use the
TLS configuration in the `tls.default` stanza. 
```
