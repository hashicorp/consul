# Catalog v2 feature preview
This release provides the ability to preview Consul's v2 Catalog and Resource API if enabled. The new model supports
multi-port application deployments with only a single Envoy proxy. Note that the v1 and v2 catalogs are not cross
compatible, and not all Consul features are available within this v2 feature preview. See the [v2 Catalog and Resource
API documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/architecture/v2) for more information. The v2 Catalog and
Resources API should be considered a feature preview within this release and should not be used in production
environments.

### Limitations
* The v2 catalog API feature preview does not support connections with client agents. As a result, it is only available for Kubernetes deployments, which use [Consul dataplanes](consul/docs/connect/dataplane) instead of client agents.
* The v1 and v2 catalog APIs cannot run concurrently.
* The Consul UI does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
* HCP Consul does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
* The v2 API only supports transparent proxy mode where services that have permissions to connect to each other can use
  Kube DNS to connect.

### Known Issues
* When using the v2 API with transparent proxy, Kubernetes pods cannot use L7 liveness, readiness, or startup probes.
