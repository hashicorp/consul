```release-note:breaking-change
api: The `/v1/health/connect/` and `/v1/health/ingress/` endpoints will now immediately return 403 "Permission Denied" errors whenever a token with insufficent `service:read` permissions is provided. Prior to this change, the endpoints would simply return a success code with an empty result list when this occurred.
```
