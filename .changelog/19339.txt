```release-note:bug
connect: Fix bug where uncleanly closed xDS connections would influence connection balancing for too long and prevent envoy instances from starting. Two new configuration fields
`performance.grpc_keepalive_timeout` and `performance.grpc_keepalive_interval` now exist to allow for configuration on how often these dead connections will be cleaned up.
