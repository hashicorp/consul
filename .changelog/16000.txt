connect: Fix configuration merging for transparent proxy upstreams. Proxy-defaults and service-defaults config entries were not correctly merged for implicit upstreams in transparent proxy mode and would result in some configuration not being applied. To avoid issues when upgrading, ensure that any proxy-defaults or service-defaults have correct configuration for upstreams, since all fields will now be properly used to configure proxies.
