```release-note:breaking-change
connect: Disable peering by default in connect proxies for Consul 1.13. This change was made to prevent inefficient polling
queries from having a negative impact on server performance. Peering in Consul 1.13 is an experimental feature and is not
recommended for use in production environments. If you still wish to use the experimental peering feature, ensure
[`peering.enabled = true`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/v1.13.x/agent/config/config-files#peering_enabled)
is set on all clients and servers.
```
