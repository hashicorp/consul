```release-note:feature
dns: queries now default to a refactored DNS server that is v1 and v2 Catalog compatible. 
Use `v1dns` in the `experiments` agent config to disable. 
The legacy server will be removed in a future release of Consul.
See the [Consul 1.19.x Release Notes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/release-notes/consul/v1_19_x) for removed DNS features.
