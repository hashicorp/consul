```release-note:deprecation
api: the `tag`, `node-meta`, and `passing` query parameters for various health and catalog
endpoints are now deprecated. The `filter` query parameter should be used as a replacement
for all of the deprecated fields. The deprecated query parameters will be removed in a future
version of Consul.
