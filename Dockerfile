# This Dockerfile contains multiple targets.
# Use 'docker build --target=<name> .' to build one.
# e.g. `docker build --target=official .`
#
# All non-dev targets have a VERSION argument that must be provided 
# via --build-arg=VERSION=<version> when building. 
# e.g. --build-arg VERSION=1.11.2
#
# `default` is the production docker image which cannot be built locally. 
# For local dev and testing purposes, please build and use the `dev` docker image.


# Official docker image that includes binaries from releases.hashicorp.com. This
# downloads the release from releases.hashicorp.com and therefore requires that
# the release is published before building the Docker image.
