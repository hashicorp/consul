# Contributing to Consul

See [our contributing guide](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

This directory contains other helpful resources like checklists for making
certain common types of changes.

## Checklists

See the `checklist-*` files in this dir to see of there is a checklist that
applies to a change you wish to make. The most common one is a change to
Consul's configuration file which has a lot more steps and subtlety than might
first appear so please use the checklist!

We recommend copying the raw Markdown lists into a local file or gist while you
work and checking tasks as you complete them (by filling in `[ ]` with `[x]`).
You can then paste the list in the PR description when you post it indicating
the steps you've already done. If you want to post an initial draft PR before
the list is complete, please still include the list as is so reviewers can see
progress. You can then check the list off on the PR description directly in
GitHub's UI after pushing the relevant fixes up.
