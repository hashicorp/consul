Usage: consul kv <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for interacting with Consul's key-value
  store. Here are some simple examples, and more detailed examples are
  available in the subcommands or the documentation.

  Create or update the key named "redis/config/connections" with the value "5":

      $ consul kv put redis/config/connections 5

  Read this value back:

      $ consul kv get redis/config/connections

  Or get detailed key information:

      $ consul kv get -detailed redis/config/connections

  Finally, delete the key:

      $ consul kv delete redis/config/connections

  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.
