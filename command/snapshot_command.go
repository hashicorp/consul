Usage: consul snapshot <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for saving, restoring, and inspecting the state
  of the Consul servers for disaster recovery. These are atomic, point-in-time
  snapshots which include key/value entries, service catalog, prepared queries,
  sessions, and ACLs.

  If ACLs are enabled, a management token must be supplied in order to perform
  snapshot operations.

  Create a snapshot:

      $ consul snapshot save backup.snap

  Restore a snapshot:

      $ consul snapshot restore backup.snap

  Inspect a snapshot:

      $ consul snapshot inspect backup.snap


  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.
