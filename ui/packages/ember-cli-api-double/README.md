# ember-cli-api-double

An ember-cli wrapper around [@hashicorp/api-double](https://github.com/hashicorp/api-double/)

Currently in a reasonable amount of 'flux'

As well as being able to use `api-double` as a simple HTTP development server to develop against, this module also provides a method of exposing your API without using an HTTP server, therefore allowing you to run ember's testing environment using your 'api-double'.
