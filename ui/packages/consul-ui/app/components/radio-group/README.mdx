# radio-group

A component for creating horizontally laid out radio groups. It seems like we
do not use the Ember component at all, but we do use the CSS component here,
so we should look at this and decide exactly what to use, and whether it needs
refactoring/deprecating.

```hbs preview-template
<RadioGroup @items={{
  array
  (hash
    key="value-1"
    value="Value 1"
  )
  (hash
    key="value-2"
    value="Value 2"
  )
}} />
```


```css
[role="radio-group"] {
  @extend %radio-group;
}
```
