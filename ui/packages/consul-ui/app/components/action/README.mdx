<!-- START component-docs:@description -->
A simple component to perform an Action.
<!-- END component-docs:@description -->

Whether that 'action' be visiting a web page, navigating to a section of a
Javascript application via the History API or dispatching a javascript
event/Ember action. It doesn't matter, just use `Action`.

**Note: You should use this for all links/buttons throughout the UI.** (apart from
links that are part of i18n translations, you'll know which ones these are as
they are in translation files, not handlebars templates) Many components export
a slightly more configured Action contextual component which will be this
component with a few more HTML attributes applied.

You don't need to worry/think about which native tag to use the component will
use the semantically correct tag depending on whether you give it a href
argument or not.

If you give the Action a `href` then that will navigate you to that hyperlink
reference (semantically this is the same as the HTML Anchor tag, and
semantically renders as one).

```hbs preview-template
  <Action
    @href={{href-to 'dc.services'}}
  >
    Click Me
  </Action>
```

If you don't give the `Action` a `href` then the action you are performing will
not be navigation you to a hyperlink reference and instead performing the action
specified, generally using the `on` modifier (semantically this is the same as
a HTML button tag, and semantically renders as one).

```hbs preview-template
  <Action
    {{on 'click' (set this 'boolean' (not this.boolean))}}
  >
    Click Me: {{if this.boolean 'On' 'Off'}}
  </Action>
```

We currently have a handy shortcut to tag the Action as an `external` hyperlink
reference. The following will add the necessary attributes for you for an
`external` link so you don't have to. This is likely to be handled automatically
in the future.

```hbs preview-template
  <Action
    @href="https://www.consul.io"
    @external={{true}}
  >
    Click Me
  </Action>
```
