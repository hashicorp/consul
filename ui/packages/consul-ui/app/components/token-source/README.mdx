### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dc` | `String` | | The name of the current datacenter |
| `nspace` | `String` | | The name of the current namespace |
| `partition` | `String` | | The name of the current partition |
| `onchange` | `Function` |  | The action to fire when the data changes. Emits an Event-like object with a `data` property containing the jwt data, in this case the autorizationCode and the status |
| `onerror` | `Function` |  | The action to fire when an error occurs. Emits ErrorEvent object with an `error` property containing the Error. |

This component will go through the steps of requesting a JWT token from a third party oauth provider. `src` should contain the full URL of the authorization URL for the 3rd party provider. Once the user has logged into the 3rd party provider the `onchange` event will be fired containing an event-like object whose data contains the JWT information.

The component need only be place into the DOM in order to begin the OAuth dance.
