# AppView

`<AppView />` is our current top level wrapping component (one level in from
the app chrome), every 'top level main section/template' should have one of
these.

This component will potentially be renamed to `Page` or `View` or similar now
that we don't need two words.

Other than that it provides the basic layout/slots for our main title, search
bar, top right hand actions and main content.

The large top margin that is visible when no breadcrumbs are visible is there
to ensure that the page doesn't 'jump around' when you navigate to a page with
breadcrumbs and back again.

```hbs preview-template
<figure>

  <AppView>

    <BlockSlot @name="header">
      <h1>
        Main title <em>{{format-number "100000"}} total {{pluralize 100000 "thing" without-count=true}} in this page</em>
      </h1>
    </BlockSlot>
    <BlockSlot @name="content">

      <EmptyState>
        <BlockSlot @name="body">
          <p>
            Nothing to see here
          </p>
        </BlockSlot>
      </EmptyState>

    </BlockSlot>
  </AppView>
