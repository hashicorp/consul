# inline-code

All `p code` within `main` and any `ModalLayer`s default to use the following
inline code CSS component.

```hbs preview-template
<p>
  This is so we can highlight code <code>inline</code> in paragraphs and such-like.
</p>
```

It can also be added to any additional elements using the following
placeholder.

```css
p code {
  @extend %inline-code;
}
```

We also have a `%block-code` that is currently contained in the same CSS files here as it shares so much of this (this should potentially be thought about and reorganized at some stage)

At the time of writing we only use this in the docs for all `<pre><code>`s.

```hbs preview-template
<pre><code>{
  "Code": true
}</code></pre>
```

```css
pre code {
  @extend %block-code;
}
```
