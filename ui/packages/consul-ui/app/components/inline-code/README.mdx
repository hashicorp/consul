# inline-code

All `p code` within `main` and any `ModalLayer`s default to use the following
inline code CSS component.

```hbs preview-template
<p>
  This is so we can highlight code <code>inline</code> in paragraphs and such-like.
</p>
```

It can also be added to any additional elements using the following
placeholder.

```css
p code {
  @extend %inline-code;
}
```
