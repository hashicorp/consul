# TabNav

`<TabNav />` renders a list of items as linked tabs (there is also an option
to use labels vs anchors for links for radio button based tabs).

Each item in the list should be a hash of `label`, `href` and `selected`.

- `label`: The text to show
- `href`: a href, probably generated via `href-to`
- `selected`: whether the item is in the selected state or not, probably
  generated via `is-href`

**Please note:** This component should probably be rebuilt using contextual
components, alternatively this could be hand built with native HTML using the
same `nav/ul/li/a` pattern and you could just use the CSS component to style
it. Unless there is a reason to do this, this component should be used pending
a refactor (please remove this note once refactored into contextual
components)

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  <figcaption>A TabNav with a conditional button using `compact` which removes empty values from arrays</figcaption>
<TabNav @items={{
  compact
      (array
          (hash label="Health Checks" href="#" selected=true)
          (hash label="Service Instances" href="#" selected=(is-href "docs.something"))
(if false (hash label="Don't show me" href="#" selected=false) '')
          (hash label="Lock Sessions" href="#" selected=false)
          (hash label="Metadata" href="#" selected=false)
      )
}}/>
</figure>
```

```css
.tab-nav {
  @extend %tab-nav;
}
```
