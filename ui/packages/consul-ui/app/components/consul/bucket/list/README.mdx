# Consul::Bucket::List

A presentational component for rendering a list of Consul 'buckets'
(a single partition and/or a single namepace).

Please note this is not your usual "scrollable list component" more a list of
'buckets' that make up a partition / namespace combination.

If only a the namespace is different to the currently selected namespace, then
the namespace will be displayed, whereas if the partition is different it will
show both the partition and namespace (as a namespace called 'team-1' in
`partition-1` is different to a namespace called 'team-1' in `partition-2`)

Showing the service name is a tiny bit awkward (different boolean type,
doesn't care about difference) and could be improved but we only use it for
the read only view of intentions.

At the time of writing, this is not currently used across the entire UI
(specifically in intentions and maybe other areas) but eventually should be.


```hbs preview-template
  <figure>
    <figcaption>Show everything</figcaption>
    <Consul::Bucket::List
      @item={{hash
        Namespace="different-nspace"
        Partition="different-partition"
        Service="service-name"
      }}
      @nspace={{'nspace'}}
      @partition={{'partition'}}
      @service={{true}}
    />
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Show just the top-level buckets</figcaption>
    <Consul::Bucket::List
      @item={{hash
        Namespace="different-nspace"
        Partition="different-partition"
      }}
      @nspace={{'nspace'}}
      @partition={{'partition'}}
    />
  </figure>

```
