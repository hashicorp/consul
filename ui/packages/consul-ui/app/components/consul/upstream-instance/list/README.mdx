A presentational component for rendering Consul Upstream Instances. Upstreams
instances are a Consul Service Instance that specifically has a relationship
with an origin Service Instance.

Currently you have to pass in the current dc, nspace and partition so that we
can figure out whether to show things that aren't in same 'bucket' that you are
currently in in the UI.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `array` |  | An array of Upstreams |
| `dc` | `string` |  | The slug of the current dc |
| `nspace` | `string` |  | The slug of the current nspace |
| `partition` | `string` |  | The slug of the current partition |
