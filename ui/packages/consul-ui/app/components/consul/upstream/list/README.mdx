as |source|>
  <Consul::Upstream::List

A presentational component for rendering Consul Upstreams (not upstream
instances). Upstreams are a Consul Service that is specifically have a
relationship with an origin Service. The Upstream 'groups' are usually only used
for showing relationships for gateways.

Currently you have to pass in the current dc, nspace and partition so that we
can figure out whether to show things that aren't in same 'bucket' that you are
currently in in the UI.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `array` |  | An array of Upstreams |
| `dc` | `string` |  | The slug of the current dc |
| `nspace` | `string` |  | The slug of the current nspace |
| `partition` | `string` |  | The slug of the current partition |
