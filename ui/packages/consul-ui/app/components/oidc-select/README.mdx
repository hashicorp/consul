# OidcSelect

OidcSelect is a mostly template only form component specifically providing a
way for the user to select their OIDC provider for their available options
which can depend upon whether they have any OIDC providers confifured for
their partition. The necessary functionality/data retrieval is all composed
together using a StateChart to orchestrate the flow.

unlike most other components which require 'buckets' specifying, this
component **does not** require a `@partition` argument as this needs to be
provided by the user.


```hbs preview-template
<OidcSelect
  @dc={{'dc-1'}}
  @nspace={{'default'}}
  @disabled={{false}}
  @onchange={{noop}}
  @onerror={{noop}}
/>
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dc` | `String` | | The name of the current datacenter |
| `nspace` | `String` | | The name of the current namespace |
| `onchange` | `Function` |  | The action to fire when an oidc provider has been selected/changed |
