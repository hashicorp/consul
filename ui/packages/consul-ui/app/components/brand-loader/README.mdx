# BrandLoader

Initial loader full brand logo as opposed to the brand submark logo.

The component is a little strange in how you configure it (a CSS-like `@width`
and `@color` properties and the subtitle as a further component), but this is due to use
wanting to source this in a JS only environment (without Glimmer/Handlebars)
during compilation of the static `index.html` file. For this reason the
template sourcecode should use extremely minimal handlebars syntax.

Also, we want the logo to appear as soon as possible, so before any CSS has
loaded, so we define its color in attributes instead of CSS.

```hbs preview-template
<div style="position: relative;height: 300px;">
  <BrandLoader
    @width="198"
    @color="#e07eac"
  >
  </BrandLoader>
</div>
```

```hbs preview-template
<div style="position: relative;height: 300px;">
  <BrandLoader
    @width="394"
    @color="#8E96A3"
  >
    <BrandLoader::Enterprise />
  </BrandLoader>
</div>
```
