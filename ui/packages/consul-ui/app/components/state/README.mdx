# State

`<State @state={{matchableStateObject}} @matches="idle">Currently Idle</State>`

`<State />` is a renderless component that eases rendering of different states
from within templates. State objects could be manually made state objects and
xstate state objects. It's very similar to a normal conditional in that if the
state identifier matches the current state, the contents of the component will
be shown.

### Arguments

| Argument/Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `state` | `object` |  | An object that implements a `match` method |
| `matches` | `String\|Array` |  | A state identifier (or array of state identifiers) to match on |


### Example

```hbs
<State @state={{state}} @matches="idle">
  Currently Idle
</State>
<State @state={{state}} @matches="loading">
  Currently Loading
</State>
<State @state={{state}} @matches={{array 'loading' 'idle'}}>
  Idle and loading
</State>
```
