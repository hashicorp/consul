## EventSource

```handlebars
<EventSource
  @src={{eventSourceObject}}
  @onerror={{action 'error'}}
/>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src` | `EventSourceProxy` | | An EventSource object |
| `onerror` | `Function` |  | The action to fire when an error occurs. Emits ErrorEvent object with an `error` property containing the Error. |
| `closeOnDestroy` | `Boolean` | true | Whether to close and destroy the event source when the component is destroyed |

This component is used to configure event source error from within a template, but also ensures that EventSources are cleaned/up destroyed when the user leaves the page (when the component is removed from the page)
