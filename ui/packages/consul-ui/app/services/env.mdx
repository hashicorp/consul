# env

Our env service (along with the `env` helper which is backed by this service)
is used to access various global 'environment style' variables throughout the
app.

```js
export default class extends Ability {
  @service('env') env;
  canRead() {
    return this.env.var('CONSUL_ACLS_ENABLED');
  }
}
```
