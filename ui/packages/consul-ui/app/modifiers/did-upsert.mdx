# did-upsert

Modifier that is called when a DOM node is inserted and/or an argument is
updated.

Additionally the callback function provided should expect an event shaped
object rather than a reference to a DOM node itself, therefore the DOM node
can be obtained by referencing `target` or `currentTarget` instead. This means
that you can use the same callback function for both `{{on 'click'}}`
modifiers and `{{did-upsert}}` modifiers. The one dowbside is that the
signature of functions used for `did-upsert` are slightly different than when
you use `did-insert/did-update`, but moving forwards we are more likely to
make `did-insert/did-update` use a more standard based signature (or some
other approach to make things consistent)

```hbs
<div
  {{did-upsert this.callback @arrayThatMightGetAddedToTODetectAnUpdate.length}}
>
</div>
```

```javascript
  callback(e) {
    console.log(e.currentTarget);
    console.log(e.target);
  }
```

Other than the above exception, the modifer works the same as the
`did-insert/did-update` modifiers.
