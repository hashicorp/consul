# notification

Consul UIs notification modifier is used to 'hoist' DOM elements into the
global notification area for the UI. The most common usage will be something
like the below:

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  <figcaption>Attach a Warning notice to the top of the app ^^^</figcaption>
  <Hds::Toast
      @color='warning'
      {{notification
         sticky=true
      }}
      as |T|>
      <T.Title>Warning!</T.Title>
      <T.Description>
        This service has been deregistered and no longer exists in the catalog.
      </T.Description>
    </Hds::Toast>
</figure>
```

Currently this is backed by `ember-cli-flash` and the named options are
currently options that can be accepted by `ember-cli-flash`. Be aware that this
is likely to change in the future.
