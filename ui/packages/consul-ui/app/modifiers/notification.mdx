# notification

Consul UIs notification modifier is used to 'hoist' DOM elements into the
global notification area for the UI. The most common usage will be something
like the below:

```hbs preview-template
<figure>
  <figcaption>Attach a Warning notice to the top of the app ^^^</figcaption>

  <Notice
    class="notification-update"
    @type="warning"
    {{notification
      sticky=true
    }}
  as |notice|>
    <notice.Header>
      <strong>Warning!</strong>
    </notice.Header>
    <notice.Body>
      <p>
        This service has been deregistered and no longer exists in the catalog.
      </p>
    </notice.Body>
  </Notice>

</figure>
```

Currently this is backed by `ember-cli-flash` and the named options are
currently options that can be accepted by `ember-cli-flash`. Be aware that this
is likely to change in the future.
