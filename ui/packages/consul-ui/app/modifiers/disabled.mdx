# disabled

The disabled modifer works similarly to the [`<fieldset disabled>`
attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset#attr-disabled),
in that it will disable all form elements within the fieldset, which is really
useful for controlling disabled states of entire forms with just one
modifier/attributes

There are three downsides to the `<fieldset disabled>` attribute:

1. It only works for fieldsets and its descendants.
2. fieldsets can cause trouble with flex-box
3. You cannot opt out for an individual form element. Say if you want to say 'all but one of these form elements should be disabled'

Therefore we use a `{{disabled true|false}}` modifier to work around these
downsides.

The following shows a disabling a group of form elements but excluding one
single form element from being disabled.

<style>
  input {
    border: 1px solid black;
  }
</style>

```hbs preview-template
<div
  {{disabled true}}
>
  Disabled: <input type="text" placeholder="Disabled" /><br />
  Disabled: <input type="checkbox" /><br />
  Enabled: <input
    {{disabled false}}
    placeholder="Not disabled"
    type="text"
  />
</div>
```
