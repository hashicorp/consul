# Colors

All colors for the immediate future should _mostly_ use the following `tone`
CSS properties, unless:

1. We get around to eventually adding semantic colors names (or adding something else) in which case these docs should be updated.
2. You are absolutely sure the color you want should never be changed by a theme. These should be very very few and far between so even if we get that wrong it should be easy to update.

`tones` should always using the following form:

```css
property: rgb(var(--tone-gray-500));
```

In other words always use `rgb` this gives us the flexibility to easily use these variables with alpha if we ever need to.

```css
property: rgb(var(--tone-gray-500) / 50);
```

Currently, alphas are mainly used for shadows. Please avoid the use of alphas for adjusting hues as they can produce unpredictable results. We should be utilizing our pre-defined color palette or adding new colors to it with proper RGB values. If you do need to add a color with alpha, please include a code comment or a self-comment explaining the use case.

Lastly, there is currently one non-color alias group which is `--tone-brand` which is a group of our current brand colors.


## %theme-light (default)

```hbs preview-template
<ul
  {{css-props (set this 'tones')
    prefix='tone-'
    group='[a-z\-]'
  }}
>
{{#each-in this.tones as |prop value|}}
  <li>
    {{#each-in value as |prop value|}}
    <figure
      {{with-copyable (concat "rgb(var(" prop "));")}}
      style={{concat "background-color: rgb(var(" prop "))"}}
    >
      <figcaption>{{prop}}</figcaption>
    </figure>
    {{/each-in}}
  </li>
{{/each-in}}
</ul>
```

## %theme-dark

If you need to build something (like a component or view) which begins in 'dark mode', you will need to switch your coloring and use

```css
%component-name {
  @extend %theme-dark;
}
```

```hbs preview-template
<ul
  {{css-props (set this 'tones')
    prefix='tone-'
    group='[a-z\-]'
  }}
>
{{#each-in this.tones as |prop value|}}
  <li>
    {{#each-in value as |prop value|}}
    <figure
      {{with-copyable (concat "rgb(var(" prop "));")}}
      style={{concat "background-color: rgb(var(" prop "))"}}
    >
      <figcaption>{{prop}}</figcaption>
    </figure>
    {{/each-in}}
  </li>
{{/each-in}}
</ul>
```
