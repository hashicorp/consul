# test

`{{and (test "is something model" item=item) (test "can read model")}}` is used
to perform a test on based on a type of model, almost the same as `ember-can`
and the `is` helper, but is more generic and extensible whilst reading nicely:

```hbs

{{#if (and (test "is crd intention" item=item) (test "can read intentions"))}}
I'm a CRD intention
{{/if}}

```

Consider using this instead of the `can` and `is` helpers, as its more generic.
