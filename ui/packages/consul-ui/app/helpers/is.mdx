# is

`{{is "something model" item=item}}` is used to perform a test on based on a
type of model, almost the same as `ember-can` but reads better to test for a
characteristic rather than an ability:

```hbs

{{#if (is "crd intention" item=item)}}
I'm a CRD intention
{{/if}}

```

Consider using the `test` helper instead.
