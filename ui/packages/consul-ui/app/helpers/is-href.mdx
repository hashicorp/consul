# is-href

`{{is-href routeName}}` is used to determine whether the current route is the
specified route, for example:

```hbs preview-template
<style>
  .is-active {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<ul>
  <li class={{if (is-href 'docs.helpers.is-href') 'is-active'}}>
    Active
  </li>
  <li class={{if (is-href 'docs.helpers.not-is-href') 'is-active'}}>
    Not Active
  </li>
</ul>
```

The Consul UI generally uses this on `<li>` elements of navigation, not the
`<a>` anchors themselves. There are cases of course where we need this for
links that are not in `<li>`s so its fine to use it on the `<a>` in those
cases.

We currently use the `is-active` classname throughout the app to mirror the
ember `<LinkTo />` class used for the same purpose.

Different to `ember-href-to` and `<LinkTo />` our custom `is-href` helper will
become `true` when you begin the transition to the specified route, not when
the specified route is loaded. This means active states will happen when the
user clicks the link and will remain active through the loading state until
the user clicks on another link.
