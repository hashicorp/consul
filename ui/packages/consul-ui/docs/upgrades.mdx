# Upgrades

## Node

Node upgrades should be done when it is convienient, preferably using the
latest Active LTS version (https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) that also
corresponds with the ember version we are on (https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/master/docs/node-support.md)

Aswell as bumping our `.nvmrc` file, when bumping
node versions, please check with the rest of the team to see if there are
other repositories that should track the same node version as this repository.

## Ember

TBD

## Other
