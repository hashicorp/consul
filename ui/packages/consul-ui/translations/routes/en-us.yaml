          default-allow:
            header: Intentions are set to default allow
            body: Your Intention settings are currently set to default allow. This means that this view will show connections to every service in your cluster. We recommend changing your Intention settings to default deny and creating specific Intentions for upstream and downstream services for this view to be useful.

This Topology view will show all of those connections if that remains unchanged. We recommend setting more specific Intentions for upstream and downstream services to make this vizualization more useful.

        intro: |
          <p>
            Upstreams are services that may receive traffic from this gateway. If you are not using Consul DNS, please make sure your <code>Host:</code> header uses the correct domain name for the gateway to correctly proxy to its upstreams. Learn more about configuring gateways in our <a href="{CONSUL_DOCS_URL}/connect/ingress-gateways" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.
