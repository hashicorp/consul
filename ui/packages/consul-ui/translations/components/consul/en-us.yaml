      header: Intentions are set to default allow
      body: Your Intention settings are currently set to default allow. This means that this view will show connections to every service in your cluster. We recommend changing your Intention settings to default deny and creating specific Intentions for upstream and downstream services for this view to be useful.

      header: Connections are not explicitly defined
      body: There appears to be an Intention allowing traffic, but the services are unable to communicate until that connection is enabled by defining an explicit upstream or proxies are set to 'transparent' mode.

    wildcard-intention:
      header: Permissive Intention
      body: One or more of your Intentions are set to allow traffic to and/or from all other services in a namespace. This Topology view will show all of those connections if that remains unchanged. We recommend setting more specific Intentions for upstream and downstream services to make this vizualization more useful.
