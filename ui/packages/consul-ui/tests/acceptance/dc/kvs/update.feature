  Background:
    Given 1 datacenter model with the value "datacenter"
  Scenario: Update to [Name] change value to [Value]
    And 1 kv model from yaml
    ---
      Key: "[Name]"
      Flags: 12
    ---
    When I visit the kv page for yaml
    ---
      dc: datacenter
      kv: "[Name]"
    ---
    Then the url should be /datacenter/kv/[EncodedName]/edit
    And the title should be "Edit Key/Value - Consul"
    # Turn the Code Editor off so we can fill the value easier
    And I click "[name=json]"
    Then I fill in with yaml
    ---
      value: [Value]
    ---
    And I submit
    Then a PUT request was made to "/v1/kv/[EncodedName]?dc=datacenter&flags=12&ns=@!namespace" with the body "[Value]"
    And "[data-notification]" has the "notification-update" class
    And "[data-notification]" has the "success" class
