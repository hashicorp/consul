# consul-api-double

Super simple API 'double' for easily visualizing the Consul API via the filesystem.

This can be served via either a simple javascript HTTP server, or entirely via frontend methods if your project/circumstances means you are unable to use or it's complicated to use a backend server for testing.

See [@hashicorp/api-double](https://github.com/hashicorp/api-double/) for more details.
