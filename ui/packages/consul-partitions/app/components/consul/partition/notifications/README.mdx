# Consul::Partition::Notifications

A Notification component specifically for Partitions. This is only a component as we currently use this in two places and if we need to add more types we can do so in one place.

We currently one have one 'remove' type due to the fact that Admin Partions can't use the default 'delete' notification as they get 'marked for deletion' instead.

```hbs preview-template
  <Consul::Partition::Notifications
    @type={{'remove'}}
  />
```
