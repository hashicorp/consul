# This file represents the canonical list of supported Envoy versions for this version of Consul.
#
# Every line must contain a valid version number in the format "x.y.z" where x, y, and z are integers.
# All other lines must be comments beginning with a "#", or a blank line.
#
# Every prior "minor" version for a given "major" (x.y) version is implicitly supported unless excluded by
# `xdscommon.UnsupportedEnvoyVersions`. For example, 1.28.3 implies support for 1.28.0, 1.28.1, and 1.28.2.
#
# See https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions for more information on Consul's Envoy
# version support.
