# Consul vs. Custom Solutions

As a code base grows, a monolithic app usually evolves into a Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA). A universal pain point for SOA is service discovery and
configuration. In many cases, this leads to organizations building home grown
solutions. It is an undisputed fact that distributed systems are hard; building
one is error prone and time consuming. Most systems cut corners by introducing
single points of failure such as a single Redis or RDBMS to maintain cluster
state. These solutions may work in the short term, but they are rarely fault
tolerant or scalable. Besides these limitations, they require time and resources
to build and maintain.

Consul provides the core set of features needed by a SOA out of the box. By
using Consul, organizations can leverage open source work to reduce their time
and resource commitment to re-inventing the wheel and focus on their business
applications.

Consul is built on well-cited research, and is designed with the constraints of
distributed systems in mind. At every step, Consul takes efforts to provide a
robust and scalable solution for organizations of any size.
