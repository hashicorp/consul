# Getting Started

The Getting Started guides will help you learn the basics of using Consul. They will walk you through how to set up a local development instance of Consul to practice running an agent, starting a service, and using Connect. Then you will set up a couple Consul servers and connect them to make a small cluster. 

After completing the guides, you will be familiar with all three of Consulâ€™s use cases, service discovery, service configuration, and service segmentation. Continue to the Getting Started guides on our learning platform [learn.hashicorp.com](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul).
