# Consul Guides

~> The Consul guides have moved to the [HashiCorp Learn platform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul).

[Guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul) are step by step command-line
walkthroughs that demonstrate how to perform common operations using Consul, and
complement the feature-focused Consul documentation.

Guide content begins with getting-started tracks to help new users learn the
basics of Consul, and continues through production-playbook tracks that cover
topics like Day 1 and Day 2 operations, production considerations, and
recommendations for securing your Consul cluster.

You can work through the guides sequentially using the tracks, or just refer to
the material that is most relevant to you.

Tracks include:

- Getting Started
- Getting Started with Kubernetes
- Day 1: Deploying Your First Datacenter
- Day 1: Security and Network Operations
- Day 1: Kubernetes Operations
- Day 2: Advanced Operations and Maintenance
- Development: Service Discovery
- Development: Service Segmentation
- Development: Service Configuration
- Integrations
