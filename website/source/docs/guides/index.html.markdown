# Consul Guides

This section provides various guides for common actions. Due to the complex nature
of Consul, some of these procedures can be complex, so our goal is to provide
guidance do doing them safely.

The following guides are available:

 * [Bootstrapping](/docs/guides/bootstrapping.html) - This guide covers bootstrapping a new
 datacenter. This covers safely adding the initial Consul servers.

 * TODO: Adding and removing servers

 * TODO: Joining datacenters

 * [External Services](/docs/guides/external.html) - This guide covers registering
 an external service. This allows using 3rd party services within the Consul framework.

 * [Forwarding](/docs/guides/forwarding.html) DNS queries from Bind to Consul
