# Consul Enterprise Enhanced Read Scalability

In [Consul Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/consul.html), servers can be
explicitly marked as non-voters. Non-voters will receive the replication stream
but will not take part in quorum (required by the leader before log entries can
be committed). Adding explicit non-voters will scale
reads
without impacting write latency.
