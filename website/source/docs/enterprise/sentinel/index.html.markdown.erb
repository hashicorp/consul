# Sentinel in Consul
Sentinel policies extend the ACL system in Consul beyond static "read", "write",
and "deny" policies to support full conditional logic and integration with
external systems. [Learn more about Sentinel here.](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/concepts/).

To get started with Sentinel in Consul,
[read the general documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/app/consul/) or
