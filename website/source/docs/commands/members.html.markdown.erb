# Consul Members

Command: `consul members`

The `members` command outputs the current list of members that a Consul
agent knows about, along with their state. The state of a node can only
be "alive", "left", or "failed".

Nodes in the "failed" state are still listed because Consul attempts to
reconnect with failed nodes for a certain amount of time in the case
that the failure is actually just a network partition.

## Usage

Usage: `consul members [options]`
