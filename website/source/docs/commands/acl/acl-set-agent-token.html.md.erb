# Consul ACL Set Agent Token

Command: `consul acl set-agent-token`

This command updates the ACL tokens currently in use by the agent. It can be used to introduce
ACL tokens to the agent for the first time, or to update tokens that were initially loaded from
the agent's configuration. Tokens are not persisted, so will need to be updated again if the
agent is restarted.

## Usage

Usage: consul acl set-agent-token [options] TYPE TOKEN


### Token Types

* `default` - The default token is the token that the agent will use for
   both internal agent operations and operations initiated by the HTTP
   and DNS interfaces when no specific token is provided. If not set the
   agent will use the anonymous token.

* `agent` - The token that the agent will use for internal agent operations.
   If not given then the default token is used for these operations.

* `master` - This sets the token that can be used to access the Agent APIs in
   the event that the ACL datacenter cannot be reached.

* `replication` - This is the token that the agent will use for replication
   operations. This token will need to be configured with read access to
   whatever data is being replicated.
