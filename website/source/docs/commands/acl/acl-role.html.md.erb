# Consul ACL Roles

Command: `consul acl role`

The `acl role` command is used to manage Consul's ACL roles. There are
subcommands for the individual operations that can be performed.

* [`create`](#create)
* [`read`](#read)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`delete`](#delete)
* [`list`](#list)

ACL roles are also accessible via the [HTTP API](/api/acl/roles.html).

Usage: `consul acl role <subcommand> [options] [args]`

-> **Note:** All of the examples show for the subcommands will require a valid
Consul token with the appropriate permissions.  Either set the
`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable to the tokens secret ID or pass the
secret ID as the value of the `-token` parameter.

## Identifying Roles

In several of the subcommands a role will have to be identified to be read,
modified, or deleted. Those subcommands support specifying the role by its ID
using the `-id` parameter or by name using the `-name` parameter. When
specifying the role by its ID a unique role ID prefix may be specified instead
of the entire UUID. As long as it is unique it will be resolved to the full
UUID and used.

## Common Subcommand Options

All of the `consul acl role` subcommands support the following options:
