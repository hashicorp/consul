# Consul ACL Policy Update

Command: `consul acl policy update`

The `acl policy update` command is used to update a policy. The default operations is to merge the current policy
with those values provided to the command invocation. Therefore to update just one field, only
the `-id` or `-name` options and the option to modify must be provided. Note that renaming
policies requires both the `-id` and `-name` as the new name cannot yet be used to lookup the
policy.

## Usage

Usage: `consul acl policy update [options] [args]`

#### API Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_client" %>
<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_server" %>

#### Command Options

* `-description=<string>` - A description of the policy.

* `-id=<string>` - The ID of the policy to update. It may be specified as a
   unique ID prefix but will error if the prefix matches multiple policy IDs

* `-meta` - Indicates that policy metadata such as the content hash and raft
  indices should be shown for each entry

* `-name=<string>` - The policy's name.

* `-no-merge` - Do not merge the current policy information with what is provided
   to the command. Instead overwrite all fields with the exception of
   the policy ID which is immutable.

* `-rules=<string>` - The policy rules. May be prefixed with `@` to indicate that
   the value is a file path to load the rules from. `-` may also be given to
   indicate that the rules are available on stdin.

* `-valid-datacenter=<value>` - Datacenter that the policy should be valid within.
   This flag may be specified multiple times.
