# Consul ACL Auth Methods

Command: `consul acl auth-method`

The `acl auth-method` command is used to manage Consul's ACL auth methods. There are
subcommands for the individual operations that can be performed.

* [`create`](#create)
* [`read`](#read)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`delete`](#delete)
* [`list`](#list)

ACL auth methods are also accessible via the [HTTP API](/api/acl/auth-methods.html).

Usage: `consul acl auth-method <subcommand> [options] [args]`

-> **Note:** All of the examples show for the subcommands will require a valid
Consul token with the appropriate permissions.  Either set the
`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable to the tokens secret ID or pass the
secret ID as the value of the `-token` parameter.

## `create`

Command: `consul acl auth-method create`

* `-description=<string>` - A description of the auth method.

* `-meta` - Indicates that auth method metadata such as the raft indices should
  be shown for each entry.

* `-name=<string>` - The new auth method's name. This flag is required.

* `-type=<string>` - The new auth method's type. This flag is required.

* `-kubernetes-ca-cert=<string>` - PEM encoded CA cert for use by the TLS

  indicate that the value is a file path to load the cert from. This flag is
  required for `-type=kubernetes`.

* `-kubernetes-host=<string>` - Address of the Kubernetes API server. This flag
  is required for `-type=kubernetes`.

* `-kubernetes-service-account-jwt=<string>` - A kubernetes service account JWT
