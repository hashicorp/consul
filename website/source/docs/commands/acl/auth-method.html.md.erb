# Consul ACL Auth Methods

Command: `consul acl auth-method`

The `acl auth-method` command is used to manage Consul's ACL auth methods.
It exposes commands for creating, updating, reading, deleting, and listing auth methods.
This command is available in Consul 1.5.0 and newer.

ACL auth methods may also be managed via the [HTTP API](/api/acl/auth-methods.html).

-> **Note:** All of the example subcommands in this document will require a valid
Consul token with the appropriate permissions.  Either set the
`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable to the token's secret ID or pass the
secret ID as the value of the `-token` parameter.

## Basic Examples

Create a new auth method:

                        -name "my-k8s" \
                        -description "This is an example kube auth method" \
                        -kubernetes-host "https://apiserver.example.com:8443" \
                        -kubernetes-ca-file /path/to/kube.ca.crt \
                        -kubernetes-service-account-jwt "JWT_CONTENTS"
```

List all auth methods:

```sh
$ consul acl auth-method list
```

Update all editable fields of the auth method:

```sh
$ consul acl auth-method update -name "my-k8s" \
                        -description "new description" \
                        -kubernetes-host "https://new-apiserver.example.com:8443" \
                        -kubernetes-ca-file /path/to/new-kube.ca.crt \
                        -kubernetes-service-account-jwt "NEW_JWT_CONTENTS"
```
