# Consul Watch

Command: `consul watch`

The `watch` command provides a mechanism to watch for changes in a particular
data view (list of nodes, service members, key value, etc) and to invoke
a process with the latest values of the view. If no process is specified,
the current values are dumped to STDOUT which can be a useful way to inspect
data in Consul.

There is more [documentation on watches here](/docs/agent/watches.html).

## Usage

Usage: `consul watch [options] [child...]`

The only required option is `-type` which specifies the particular
data view. Depending on the type, various options may be required
or optionally provided. There is more documentation on watch
[specifications here](/docs/agent/watches.html).
