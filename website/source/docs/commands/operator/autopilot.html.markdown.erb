Usage: consul operator autopilot <subcommand> [options]

The Autopilot operator command is used to interact with Consul's Autopilot
subsystem. The command can be used to view or modify the current configuration.

Subcommands:

    get-config    Display the current Autopilot configuration
    set-config    Modify the current Autopilot configuration
```

## get-config

This command displays the current Raft peer configuration.

Usage: `consul operator autopilot get-config [options]`

#### API Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_client" %>
<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_server" %>

The output looks like this:

```
CleanupDeadServers = true
LastContactThreshold = 200ms
MaxTrailingLogs = 250
ServerStabilizationTime = 10s
RedundancyZoneTag = ""
DisableUpgradeMigration = false
UpgradeMigrationTag = ""
```

## set-config

Modifies the current Autopilot configuration.

Usage: `consul operator autopilot set-config [options]`

#### API Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_client" %>
<%= partial "docs/commands/http_api_options_server" %>

#### Command Options

* `-cleanup-dead-servers` - Specifies whether to enable automatic removal of dead servers
upon the successful joining of new servers to the cluster. Must be one of `[true|false]`.

* `-last-contact-threshold` - Controls the maximum amount of time a server can go without contact
from the leader before being considered unhealthy. Must be a duration value such as `200ms`.

* `-max-trailing-logs` - Controls the maximum number of log entries that a server can trail
the leader by before being considered unhealthy.

* `-server-stabilization-time` - Controls the minimum amount of time a server must be stable in
the 'healthy' state before being added to the cluster. Only takes effect if all servers are
running Raft protocol version 3 or higher. Must be a duration value such as `10s`.

* `-disable-upgrade-migration` - (Enterprise-only) Controls whether Consul will avoid promoting
new servers until it can perform a migration. Must be one of `[true|false]`.

* `-redundancy-zone-tag`- (Enterprise-only) Controls the [`-node-meta`](/docs/agent/options.html#_node_meta)
key name used for separating servers into different redundancy zones.

* `-upgrade-version-tag` - (Enterprise-only) Controls the [`-node-meta`](/docs/agent/options.html#_node_meta)
tag to use for version info when performing upgrade migrations. If left blank, the Consul version will be used.

The output looks like this:
