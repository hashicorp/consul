# Consul on Azure Kubernetes Service

Consul can run directly on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). To get hands-on experience, you can follow the [Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Azure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/azure-k8s?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=aks) guide.

The Learn guide includes:

- AKS configuration recommendations
- How to install Consul with the official Helm chart
- Deploying two services in the Consul Connect service mesh.

To complete this guide, you will need a Azure Cloud account.
