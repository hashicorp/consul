# Consul on Azure Kubernetes Service

Consul can run directly on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 

To get hands-on experience, you can use the ["Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Azure"](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/azure-k8s?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=aks) guide.

In the Learn guide, you'll install a Consul on AKS with the official Helm chart. After installing Consul, you'll then deploy two microservices.
