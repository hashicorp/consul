# Consul on Minikube

Consul can run directly on Minikube for testing. To get hands-on experience, you can use the [Consul on Minikube via Helm](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/minikube?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=mk) guide.

The Learn guide includes how to:

- Install Consul on Minikube with the official Helm chart. After
- Access Consul with the Consul UI, CLI, and API
- Deploy services in the Consul Connect service mesh.
