# Consul on Minikube

Consul can run directly on Minikube for testing.  

To get hands-on experience, you can use the ["Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Google Cloud"](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/minikube?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=mk) guide.

In the Learn guide, you'll install a Consul on AKS with the official Helm chart. After installing, you'll learn how to access Consul. Consul on GKE can be accessed using the Consul UI, CLI, and API.
