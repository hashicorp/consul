# Consul on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

Consul can run directly on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). To get hands-on experience, you can use the [Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Amazon EKS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/aws-k8s?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=eks) guide.

The Learn guide includes:

- EKS configuration recommendations
- How to install Consul on Amazon EKS with the official Helm chart
- Accessing Consul with the Consul UI, CLI, and API.

You will need a Amazon Web Services account to complete this guide.
