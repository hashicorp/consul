# Consul on Google Kubernetes Engine

Consul can run directly on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). To get hands-on experience, you can use the [Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Google Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/kubernetes/google-cloud-k8s?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=k8s&utm_term=gke) guide.

The Learn guide includes:

- GKE configuration recommendations
- How to install Consul on GKE with the official Helm chart
- Accessing Consul with the Consul UI, CLI, and API.

You will need a Google Cloud account to complete this guide.
