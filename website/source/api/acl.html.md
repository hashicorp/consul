# ACL HTTP API

The `/acl` endpoints create, update, destroy, and query ACL tokens in Consul.

## Create ACL Token

This endpoint makes a new ACL token.

| Method | Path                         | Produces                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `PUT`  | `/acl/create`                | `application/json`         |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/index.html#blocking-queries),
[consistency modes](/api/index.html#consistency-modes), and
[required ACLs](/api/index.html#acls).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `management` |

### Parameters

- `ID` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of the ACL. If not provided, a UUID is
  generated.

- `Name` `(string: "")` - Specifies a human-friendly name for the ACL token.

- `Type` `(string: "client")` - Specifies the type of ACL token. Valid values
  are: `client` and `management`.

- `Rules` `(string: "")` - Specifies rules for this ACL token. The format of the
  `Rules` property is documented in the [ACL Guide](/docs/guides/acl.html).

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "Name": "my-app-token",
  "Type": "client",
  "Rules": ""
}
```

### Sample Request

[consistency modes](/api/index.html#consistency-modes), and
[required ACLs](/api/index.html#acls).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `management` |

### Parameters

The parameters are the same as the _create_ endpoint, except the `ID` field is
required.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "ID": "adf4238a-882b-9ddc-4a9d-5b6758e4159e",

$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data @payload.json \
    https://consul.rocks/v1/acl/update
```

## Delete ACL Token

This endpoint deletes an ACL token with the given ID.

| Method | Path                         | Produces                   |

    --request PUT \
    https://consul.rocks/v1/acl/destroy/8f246b77-f3e1-ff88-5b48-8ec93abf3e05
```

## Read ACL Token

This endpoint reads an ACL token with the given ID.

| Method | Path                         | Produces                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/acl/info/:uuid`            | `application/json`         |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/index.html#blocking-queries),
[consistency modes](/api/index.html#consistency-modes), and
[required ACLs](/api/index.html#acls).

  }
]
```

## Clone ACL Token

This endpoint clones an ACL and returns a new token `ID`. This allows a token to
serve as a template for others, making it simple to generate new tokens without
complex rule management.

[blocking queries](/api/index.html#blocking-queries),
[consistency modes](/api/index.html#consistency-modes), and
[required ACLs](/api/index.html#acls).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `management` |

### Parameters

- `uuid` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the UUID of the ACL token to
  be cloned. This is required and is specified as part of the URL path.

### Sample Request

```text
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    https://consul.rocks/v1/acl/clone/8f246b77-f3e1-ff88-5b48-8ec93abf3e05
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "ID": "adf4238a-882b-9ddc-4a9d-5b6758e4159e"
}
```

    "Type": "client",
    "Rules": "..."
  }
]
```

## Check ACL Replication

This endpoint returns the status of the ACL replication process in the
datacenter. This is intended to be used by operators, or by automation checking
the health of ACL replication.

Please see the [ACL Guide](/docs/guides/acl.html#replication) replication
section for more details.

| Method | Path                         | Produces                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/acl/replication`           | `application/json`         |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/index.html#blocking-queries),
[consistency modes](/api/index.html#consistency-modes), and
[required ACLs](/api/index.html#acls).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | ACL Required |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `NO`             | `consistent`      | `none`       |

### Parameters

- `dc` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter to query. This will default to
  the datacenter of the agent being queried. This is specified as part of the
  URL as a query parameter.

### Sample Request

```text
$ curl \
    https://consul.rocks/v1/acl/replication
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "Enabled": true,
  "Running": true,
  "SourceDatacenter": "dc1",
  "ReplicatedIndex": 1976,
  "LastSuccess": "2016-08-05T06:28:58Z",
  "LastError": "2016-08-05T06:28:28Z"
}
```

- `Enabled` reports whether ACL replication is enabled for the datacenter.

- `Running` reports whether the ACL replication process is running. The process
  may take approximately 60 seconds to begin running after a leader election
  occurs.

- `SourceDatacenter` is the authoritative ACL datacenter that ACLs are being
  replicated from, and will match the
  [`acl_datacenter`](/docs/agent/options.html#acl_datacenter) configuration.

- `ReplicatedIndex` is the last index that was successfully replicated. You can
  compare this to the `X-Consul-Index` header returned by the
  [`/v1/acl/list`](#acl_list) endpoint to determine if the replication process
  has gotten all available ACLs. Replication runs as a background process
  approximately every 30 seconds, and that local updates are rate limited to 100
  updates/second, so so it may take several minutes to perform the initial sync
  of a large set of ACLs. After the initial sync, replica lag should be on the
  order of about 30 seconds.

- `LastSuccess` is the UTC time of the last successful sync operation. Since ACL
  replication is done with a blocking query, this may not update for up to 5
  minutes if there have been no ACL changes to replicate. A zero value of
  "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" will be present if no sync has been successful.

- `LastError` is the UTC time of the last error encountered during a sync
  operation. If this time is later than `LastSuccess`, you can assume the
  replication process is not in a good state. A zero value of
  "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" will be present if no sync has resulted in an error.
