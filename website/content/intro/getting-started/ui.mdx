# Consul Web UI

Consul comes with support for beautiful, functional web UIs out of the
box. UIs can be used for viewing all services and nodes, for viewing
all health checks and their current status, and for reading and setting
key/value data. The UIs automatically support multi-datacenter.

To set up the self-hosted UI, start the Consul agent with the
[`-ui` parameter](/docs/agent/options#_ui):

```shell-session
$ consul agent -ui
...
```

The UI is available at the `/ui` path on the same port as the HTTP API.
By default this is `http://localhost:8500/ui`.

You can view a live demo of the Consul Web UI
[here](http://demo.consul.io).
