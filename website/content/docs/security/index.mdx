  Consul relies on both a lightweight gossip mechanism and an RPC system to
  provide various features. Both of the systems have different security
  mechanisms that stem from their designs. However, the security mechanisms of
  Consul have a common goal: to provide confidentiality, integrity, and
  authentication.

## Security Models

Requirements and recommendations for operating a secure Consul deployment may vary drastically depending on your
intended workloads, operating system, and environment. You can find detailed information about the various personas,
recommendations, requirements, and threats [here](/docs/security/security-models).

## ACLs

Consul provides an optional [Access Control List (ACL) system](/docs/security/acl) which can be used to control access
to data and APIs.

## Encryption

The Consul agent supports encrypting all of its network traffic. The exact method of encryption is described on the
[encryption security page](/docs/security/encryption). There are two separate encryption systems, one for gossip
traffic and one for HTTP + RPC.
