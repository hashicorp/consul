# Namespaces overview

<EnterpriseAlert>

This feature requires
HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) or self-managed Consul Enterprise.
Refer to the [enterprise feature matrix](/consul/docs/enterprise#consul-enterprise-feature-availability) for additional information.

</EnterpriseAlert>

With Consul Enterprise 1.7.0+, data for different users or teams
can be isolated from each other with the use of namespaces. Namespaces help reduce operational challenges
by removing restrictions around uniqueness of resource names across distinct teams, and enable operators
to provide self-service through delegation of administrative privileges.

For more information on how to use namespaces with Consul Enterprise please review the following tutorials:

- [Register and Discover Services within Namespaces](/consul/tutorials/namespaces/namespaces-share-datacenter-access?utm_source=docs) - Register multiple services within different namespaces in Consul.
- [Setup Secure Namespaces](/consul/tutorials/namespaces/namespaces-secure-shared-access?utm_source=docs) - Secure resources within a namespace and delegate namespace ACL rights via ACL tokens.
