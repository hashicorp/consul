# Namespaces overview

@include 'alerts/enterprise-alert.mdx'

This page provides an overview of Consul namespaces. 

## Overview

You can use Consul namespaces to isolate data for different users or teams with Consul Enterprise. Namespaces help reduce operational challenges around different teams using resources with identical names, and enable operators
to provide self-service through delegation of administrative privileges.

## Guidance

For more information on how to use namespaces with Consul Enterprise, refer to the following resources.

- [Setup Consul namespaces on VMs](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/vm?utm_source=docs) - Secure resources within a namespace and delegate namespace ACL rights via ACL tokens.
- [Using Consul and Kubernetes namespaces](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/k8s) - Secure Consul resources within namespaces and interact with Kubernetes namespaces.
- [Register services into a namespace](/consul/docs/register/service/namespace?utm_source=docs) - Register multiple services within different namespaces in Consul.
