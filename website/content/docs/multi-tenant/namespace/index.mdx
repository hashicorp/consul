# Namespaces overview

@include 'alerts/enterprise-alert.mdx'

Since Consul Enterprise 1.7.0+, data for different users or teams
can be isolated from each other with the use of namespaces. Namespaces help reduce operational challenges by removing restrictions around  uniqueness of resource names across distinct teams, and enable operators
to provide self-service through delegation of administrative privileges.

For more information on how to use namespaces with Consul Enterprise please review the following documentation:

- [Setup Consul namespaces on VMs](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/vm?utm_source=docs) - Secure resources within a namespace and delegate namespace ACL rights via ACL tokens.
- [Using Consul and Kubernetes namespaces](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/k8s) - Secure Consul resources within namespaces and interact with Kubernetes namespaces.
- [Register services into a namespace](/consul/docs/register/service/namespace?utm_source=docs) - Register multiple services within different namespaces in Consul.
