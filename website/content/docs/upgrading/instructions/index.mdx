# Upgrade Instructions

This document is intended to help users who find themselves many versions behind to upgrade safely.
Our recommended upgrade path is moving from version 0.8.5 to 1.2.4 to 1.6.9 to the current version. To get
started, you will want to choose the version you are currently on below and then follow the instructions
until you are on the latest version. The upgrade guides will mention notable changes and link to relevant
changelogs – we recommend reviewing the changelog for versions between the one you are on and the
one you are upgrading to at each step to familiarize yourself with changes.
