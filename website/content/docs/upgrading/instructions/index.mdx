# Upgrade Instructions

This document is intended to help users who find themselves many versions behind to upgrade safely.

## General Upgrade Path

Each upgrade should jump at most 2 major versions, except where
[dedicated instructions](#dedicated-instructions-for-specific-upgrade-paths)
are provided for a larger jump between specific versions.
If your upgrade path has no applicable [dedicated instructions](#dedicated-instructions-for-specific-upgrade-paths),
review the [version-specific upgrade details](/consul/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific)
to plan your upgrade, starting from the next version and working
upwards to your target version.

For example, to upgrade from Consul 1.12 to Consul 1.15:

1. Upgrade to Consul 1.14 as an intermediate step.
   To plan, review the upgrade details for
   [1.13](/consul/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-13-x) and
   [1.14](/consul/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-14-x).
1. Upgrade to Consul 1.15.
   To plan, review the upgrade details for
   [1.15](/consul/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-15-x).

## Dedicated Instructions for Specific Upgrade Paths

The following table provides links to dedicated instructions
for directly upgrading from a version in the starting range
to a destination version.
