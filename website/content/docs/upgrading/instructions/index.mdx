## Upgrade Path

Our recommended upgrade path is to move through the following sequence of versions:

- 0.8.5 (final 0.8.x)
- 1.2.4 (final 1.2.x)

## Getting Started

To get instructions for your upgrade, follow the instructions given below for
your _currently installed_ release series until you are on the latest current version.
The upgrade guides will mention notable changes and link to relevant changelogs –
we recommend reviewing the changelog for versions between the one you are on and the
one you are upgrading to at each step to familiarize yourself with changes.
