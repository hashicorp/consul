## Getting Started

To get instructions for your upgrade, follow the instructions given below for
your _currently installed_ release series until you are on the latest current version.
The upgrade guides will mention notable changes and link to relevant changelogs â€“
we recommend reviewing the changelog for versions between the one you are on and the
one you are upgrading to at each step to familiarize yourself with changes.
