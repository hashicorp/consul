# Registration

Registering AWS Lambdas into Consul requires:
1. Registering a service into Consul.
2. Writing a service defaults configuration entry for the Lambda.

Keeping these configurations up to date is a precise and error-prone process,
so we build [Lambda registrator](/docs/lambda/registration/lambda-registrator)
to automatically syncronize Lambda state into Consul. Lambda registrator
automatically registers, reconfigures, and deregisters Lambdas based on the
[Lambda's tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-tags.html).

Lambdas can also be [manually registered into
Consul](/docs/lambda/registration/manual) when using Lambda registrator is not
possible.
