# AWS Lambda

Lambda functions are programs or scripts that run in AWS Lambda. The functions process events and return responses. Refer to the [AWS Lambda website](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for additional information.

## How AWS Lambda Functions on Consul Work

You can register AWS Lambda functions in Consul and invoke them from mesh services.
### Registering Lambda Functions

Registering AWS Lambda functions into Consul requires [registering a service](/docs/discovery/services)
and storing a [service defaults configuration entry](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-defaults)
into Consul.

We recommend using [Lambda registrator](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul-lambda-registrator)
to automatically synchronize Lambda functions into Consul. Lambda functions can
also be manually registered into Consul when using Lambda registrator is not possible.

See the [Registration page](/docs/lambda/registration) for more information
about registring Lambda functions into Consul.

### Invoking Lambda Functions

Lambda functions can be invoked by any mesh service directly from connect proxies or
through terminating gateways. The [Invocation page](/docs/lambda/invocation)
explains how to invoke Lambda functions from Consul connect services.
