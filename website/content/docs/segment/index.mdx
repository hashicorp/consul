# Segment network for datacenter multi-tenancy

This topic provides an overview of Consul's multi-tenancy features. A single Consul datacenter can support multiple teams and organizations by restricting resources, service traffic, and user access to a combination of admin partitions, namespaces, networking segments, and sameness groups.

Consul Community Edition supports the `default` partition and `default` namespace, but does not support multi-tenancy. For more information, refer to [Consul Enterprise](/consul/docs/enterprise).

## Introduction

In large enterprise organizations, configuring, deploying, securing, and managing separate Consul datacenters for each team or project can be an impractical and resource-intensive solution. Consul Enterprise users can implement multi-tenant configurations of Consul server clusters so that teams can share a set of Consul servers. This arrangement can lower deployment costs while maintaining network security and preventing conflicts in resource names.

The two main elements in Consul's multi-tenancy support are _admin partitions_ and _namespaces_. Consul namespaces are distinct from Kubernetes Namespaces, but you can configure Consul to mirror existing Kubernetes Namespaces. Consul also supports multi-tenancy configurations for networks that are segmented according to firewalls, and enables operators to manage a set of admin partitions and namespaces using sameness groups.

## Admin partitions

## Namespaces

@include 'feature/namespace.mdx'

## Network segments

@include 'feature/network-segment.mdx'

## Sameness groups

@include 'feature/sameness-group.mdx'

## Reference documentation

The most experienced users want to quickly find the reference information for specific parts of the component they are using. List all relevant reference pages for the topic.

## Constraints, limitations, and troubleshooting

If you experience errors when implementing multi-tenancy on Consul deployments, refer to the following list of technical constraints.

- WAN-federated Consul deployments support the `default` admin partition only.
- Samneness groups must be configured on each partition that is a member of the group.
