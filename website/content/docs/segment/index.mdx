# Segment network for datacenter multi-tenancy

This topic provides an overview of Consul's multi-tenancy features. A single Consul datacenter can support multiple teams and organizations by restricting resources, service traffic, and user access to a combination of admin partitions, namespaces, networking segments, and sameness groups.

Consul Community Edition supports the `default` partition and `default` namespace, but does not support multi-tenancy. For more information, refer to [Consul Enterprise](/consul/docs/enterprise).

## Introduction

In large enterprise organizations, configuring, deploying, securing, and managing separate Consul datacenters for each team or project can be an impractical and resource-intensive solution. Consul Enterprise users can implement multi-tenant configurations of Consul server clusters so that teams can share a set of Consul servers. This arrangement can lower deployment costs while maintaining network security and preventing conflicts in resource names.

The two main elements in Consul's multi-tenancy support are _admin partitions_ and _namespaces_. Consul namespaces are distinct from Kubernetes Namespaces, but you can configure Consul to mirror existing Kubernetes Namespaces. Consul also supports multi-tenancy configurations for networks that are segmented according to firewalls, and enables operators to manage a set of admin partitions and namespaces using sameness groups.

## Tutorials

To get started with the features described on this page, refer to the following tutorials:

- [Multi-Tenancy with Administrative Partitions](/consul/tutorials/enterprise/consul-admin-partitions?utm_source=docs)
- [Multi Cluster Applications with Consul Enterprise Admin Partitions](/consul/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-admin-partitions?utm_source=docs)
- [Setup secure namespaces](/consul/tutorials/namespaces/namespaces-secure-shared-access)
- [Register and discover services within namespaces](/consul/tutorials/namespaces/namespaces-share-datacenter-access)

## Runtime-specific usage documentation

For runtime-specific guidance, refer to the following pages:
