# Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise

Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) Enterprise is available with [Consul Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul) and requires a Consul [license](/docs/nia/enterprise/license) to be applied.

Enterprise features of CTS address organization complexities of collaboration, operations, scale, and governance. CTS Enterprise supports an official integration with [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud) to extend insight into dynamic updates of your network infrastructure.
