# Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise License
<EnterpriseAlert>
  Licenses are only required for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise
</EnterpriseAlert>

Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise binaries require a [Consul Enterprise license](/docs/enterprise/license/overview) to run. There is no Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise specific license. As a result, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise's licensing is very similar to Consul Enterprise.

All features offered in Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise is available with any valid, unexpired Consul Enterprise license. It is not dependent on your Consul Enterprise packaging or pricing model.

To get a trial license for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise, you can sign-up for the [trial license for Consul Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-where-can-users-get-a-trial-license-for-consul-enterprise).

## Setting the License

Depending on how you would like to set the license, have the license value at hand or saved in a file to disk.

The options to set the license in order of precedence:
 - `CONSUL_LICENSE`: environment variable to set the license value
 - `CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH`: environment variable to set the path to the file containing the license
 - [`license_path`](/docs/nia/configuration#license_path): configuration file variable to set the path to the file containing the license

Note: the [options to set the license and order of precedence](/docs/enterprise/license/overview#binaries-without-built-in-licenses) is the same as Consul Enterprise server agents.

## Notification and Termination Behavior

Licenses have an expiration date and termination date where termination is a time at or after expiration. Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will cease to function once the termination date has passed. The time between the expiration and termination date is a grace period. Grace periods are generally 24-hours; however, please refer to your license for accurate understanding of your grace period.

When approaching expiration and termination, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will provide notifications in the system logs:

| Time period                                 | Behavior                          |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 30 days before expiration                   | Warning-level log every 24-hours  |
| 7 days before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 hour    |
| 1 hour before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 minute  |
| 1 day before expiration                     | Warning-level log every 5 minutes |
| At or after expiration (before termination) | Error-level log every 1 minute    |
| At or after termination                     | Error-level log and exit          |

Note: notification frequency and [grace period](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-is-there-a-grace-period-when-licenses-expire) behavior is the same as Consul Enterprise.
