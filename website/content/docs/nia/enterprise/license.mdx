# Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise License

<EnterpriseAlert>
  Licenses are only required for Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) Enterprise
</EnterpriseAlert>

CTS Enterprise binaries require a [Consul Enterprise license](/docs/enterprise/license/overview) to run. There is no CTS Enterprise specific license. As a result, CTS Enterprise's licensing is very similar to Consul Enterprise.

All CTS Enterprise features are available with a valid Consul Enterprise license, regardless of your Consul Enterprise packaging or pricing model.

To get a trial license for CTS, you can sign-up for the [trial license for Consul Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-where-can-users-get-a-trial-license-for-consul-enterprise).

## Setting the License

Choose one of the following methods (in order of precedence) to set the license:

1. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE` environment variable to the license string.

   ```shell-session
   export CONSUL_LICENSE=<LICENSE_VALUE>
   ```

1. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable to the path of the file containing the license.

   ```shell-session
   export CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH=<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>
   ```

1. Configure the [`license_path`](/docs/nia/configuration#license_path) option in the configuration file to point to the file containing the license.

   ```hcl
   license_path = "<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>"
   ```

~> **Note**: the [options to set the license and the order of precedence](/docs/enterprise/license/overview#binaries-without-built-in-licenses) are the same as Consul Enterprise server agents.
Visit the [Enterprise License Tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/hashicorp-enterprise-license?in=consul/enterprise) for detailed steps on how to install the license key.

### Updating the License

The previous section describes options for [setting the license](#setting-the-license) needed to start running CTS Enterprise. Use the following procedure to update the license when it expires or is near the expiration date:

1. Update the license environment variable or configuration with the new license value or path to the new license file
1. Stop and restart CTS Enterprise

Once CTS Enterprise starts again, it will pick up the new license and run the tasks with any changes that may have occurred between the stop and restart period.

## Notification and Termination Behavior

Licenses have an expiration date and a termination date. The termination date is a time at or after the license expires. CTS Enterprise will cease to function once the termination date has passed.

The time between the expiration and termination dates is a grace period. Grace periods are generally 24-hours, but you should refer to your license agreement for complete terms of your grace period.

When approaching expiration and termination, CTS Enterprise will provide notifications in the system logs:

| Time period                                 | Behavior                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 30 days before expiration                   | Warning-level log every 24-hours  |
| 7 days before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 hour    |
| 1 hour before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 minute  |
| 1 day before expiration                     | Warning-level log every 5 minutes |
| At or after expiration (before termination) | Error-level log every 1 minute    |
| At or after termination                     | Error-level log and exit          |

~> **Note**: Notification frequency and [grace period](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-is-there-a-grace-period-when-licenses-expire) behavior is the same as Consul Enterprise.
