# Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise License

<EnterpriseAlert>
  Licenses are only required for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise
</EnterpriseAlert>

Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise binaries require a [Consul Enterprise license](/docs/enterprise/license/overview) to run. There is no Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise specific license. As a result, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise's licensing is very similar to Consul Enterprise.

All Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise features are available with a valid Consul Enterprise license, regardless of your Consul Enterprise packaging or pricing model.

To get a trial license for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise, you can sign-up for the [trial license for Consul Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-where-can-users-get-a-trial-license-for-consul-enterprise).

## Setting the License

Choose one of the following methods (in order of precedence) to set the license:

1. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE` environment variable to the license string.

```shell-session
export CONSUL_LICENSE=<LICENSE_VALUE>
```

2. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable to the path of the file containing the license.

```shell-session
export CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH=<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>
```

3. Configure the [`license_path`](/docs/nia/configuration#license_path) option in the configuration file to point to the file containing the license.

```hcl
license_path = "<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>"
```

~> **Note**: the [options to set the license and the order of precedence](/docs/enterprise/license/overview#binaries-without-built-in-licenses) are the same as Consul Enterprise server agents.
Visit the [Enterprise License Tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/hashicorp-enterprise-license?in=consul/enterprise) for detailed steps on how to install the license key.

### Updating the License

The previous section describes options for [setting the license](#setting-the-license) needed to start running Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise. Use the following procedure to update the license when it expires or is near the expiration date:

1. Update the license environment variable or configuration with the new license value or path to the new license file
1. Stop and restart Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise

Once Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise starts again, it will pick up the new license and run the tasks with any changes that may have occurred between the stop and restart period.

## Notification and Termination Behavior

Licenses have an expiration date and a termination date. The termination date is a time at or after the license expires. Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will cease to function once the termination date has passed.

The time between the expiration and termination dates is a grace period. Grace periods are generally 24-hours, but you should refer to your license agreement for complete terms of your grace period.

When approaching expiration and termination, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will provide notifications in the system logs:

| Time period                                 | Behavior                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 30 days before expiration                   | Warning-level log every 24-hours  |
| 7 days before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 hour    |
| 1 hour before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 minute  |
| 1 day before expiration                     | Warning-level log every 5 minutes |
| At or after expiration (before termination) | Error-level log every 1 minute    |
| At or after termination                     | Error-level log and exit          |

~> **Note**: Notification frequency and [grace period](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-is-there-a-grace-period-when-licenses-expire) behavior is the same as Consul Enterprise.
