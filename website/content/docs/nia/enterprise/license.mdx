# Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise License
<EnterpriseAlert>
  Licenses are only required for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise
</EnterpriseAlert>

Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise binaries require a [Consul Enterprise license](/docs/enterprise/license/overview) to run. There is no Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise specific license. As a result, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise's licensing is very similar to Consul Enterprise.

All Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise features are available with a valid Consul Enterprise license., regardless of your Consul Enterprise packaging or pricing model.

To get a trial license for Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise, you can sign-up for the [trial license for Consul Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-where-can-users-get-a-trial-license-for-consul-enterprise).

## Setting the License

Choose one of the following methods (in order of precedence) to set the license:

1. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE` environment variable to the license string, e.g.,:

`export CONSUL_LICENSE=<LICENSE_VALUE>`

2. Set the `CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable to the path of the file containing the license.

`export CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH=<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>`

3. Configure the [`license_path`](/docs/nia/configuration#license_path) option in the configuration file to point to the file containing the license.

`license_path=<PATH>/<TO>/<FILE>`


~> **Note**: the [options to set the license and the order of precedence](/docs/enterprise/license/overview#binaries-without-built-in-licenses) are the same as Consul Enterprise server agents.

## Notification and Termination Behavior

Licenses have an expiration date and a termination date. The termination date is a time at or after the license expires. Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will cease to function once the termination date has passed. 

The time between the expiration and termination dates is a grace period. Grace periods are generally 24-hours, but you should refer to your license agreement for complete terms of your grace period.

When approaching expiration and termination, Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise will provide notifications in the system logs:

| Time period                                 | Behavior                          |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 30 days before expiration                   | Warning-level log every 24-hours  |
| 7 days before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 hour    |
| 1 hour before expiration                    | Warning-level log every 1 minute  |
| 1 day before expiration                     | Warning-level log every 5 minutes |
| At or after expiration (before termination) | Error-level log every 1 minute    |
| At or after termination                     | Error-level log and exit          |

~> **Note**: Notification frequency and [grace period](/docs/enterprise/license/faq#q-is-there-a-grace-period-when-licenses-expire) behavior is the same as Consul Enterprise.
