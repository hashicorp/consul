# Error Messages

This topic explains error messages you may encounter when using Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS). 

## Example error log messages

If you configured the CTS cluster to run in [high availability mode](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha) and the local module is missing, then the following message appears in the log:

```shell-session
[ERROR] ha.compat: error="compatibility check failure: stat ./example-module: no such file or directory"
```

The resolution is to add the missing local module on the incompatible CTS instance. Refer to the [`module` documentation](/consul/docs/nia/configuration#module) in the CTS configuration reference for additional information. 

## Example API and CLI error messages

**Error**:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "redirect requests to leader 'cts-01' at cts-01.example.com:8558"
    }
}
```

**Conditions**:

- CTS can determine the leader.
- `high_availability.instance.address` is configured for the leader.
- The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader.



**Resolution**:

Redirect the request to the leader instance, for example:

```shell-session
$ curl --request GET cts-01.example.com:8558/v1/tasks
```
---


**Error**:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "redirect requests to leader 'cts-01'"
    }
}
```

**Conditions**:

* CTS can determine the leader.
* The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader.
* `high_availability.instance.address` is not configured.

**Resolution**:

Identify the leader instance address and redirect the request to the leader. You can identify the leader by calling the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/nia/api/status#cluster-status) or by checking the logs for the following entry:

```shell-session
[INFO] ha: acquired leadership lock: id=<ID-OF-CTS-INSTANCE>. 

We recommend deploying a cluster that has three instances.

**Error**:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "redirect requests to leader"
    }
}
```

**Conditions**:

* The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader. 
* The CTS is unable to determine the leader. 
* Note that these conditions are rare.


**Resolution**:

Identify and send the request to the leader CTS instance. You can identify the leader by calling the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/nia/api/status#cluster-status) or by checking the logs for the following entry:

```shell-session
[INFO] ha: acquired leadership lock: id=<ID-OF-CTS-INSTANCE>
```

---

**Error**:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "this endpoint is only available with high availability configured"
  }
}
```

**Conditions**:

- You called the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/nia/api/status#cluster-status) without configuring CTS for [high availability](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha).

**Resolution**:

Configure CTS to run in [high availability mode](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha).

---

**Error**:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "example error message: unsupported status parameter value"
  }
}
```

**Conditions**: 

- You sent a request to the `status` API endpoint.
- The request included an unsupported parameter value.

**Resolution**:

Send a new request and verify that all of the parameter values are correct.
