# Consul-Terraform-Sync API

When running in [daemon mode](/docs/nia/cli#daemon-mode), Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) serves an HTTP API interface. Details of the available API endpoints is available in the navigation to the left.

### Port

The API is served at the default port `8558` or a different port if set with [`port` configuration](/docs/nia/configuration#port)

### Version Prefix

All API routes are prefixed with `/v1/`. This documentation is for v1 of the API, which is the only version currently.

Example: `localhost:8558/v1/status`

### Error

Successful API requests will receive a 2XX success status code. For other unsuccessful status codes, when possible, more details will be provided in a response body containing an error object.

Example: Status 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "example error message: unsupported status parameter value"
  }
}
```
