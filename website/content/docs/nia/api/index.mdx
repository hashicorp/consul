# Consul-Terraform-Sync API Overview

Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) provides an HTTP API interface for querying CTS instances and running and managing tasks.   

## Port

The API is served at the default port `8558` or a different port if set with [`port` configuration](/consul/docs/nia/configuration#port)

## Version prefix

All API routes are prefixed with `/v1/`. This documentation is for v1 of the API, which is the only version currently.

Example: `localhost:8558/v1/status`

## Request ID

Each call to a CTS API endpoint returns a `request_id` field. The field is a string generated by the API. Example:

`"request_id": "e1bc2236-3d0e-5f5e-dc51-164a1cf6da88"`

## Error messages

The API sends a response code in the 200 range if the call is successful. If the call is unsuccessful, the API sends an error message that includes additional information when possible. Refer to [Error Messages](/consul/docs/nia/usage/errors-ref) for additional information.
