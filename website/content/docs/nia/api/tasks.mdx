# Tasks

The `/tasks` endpoints modify the tasks that Consul-Terraform-Sync is responsible for running.

## Update Task

This endpoint allows patch updates to specifically supported fields for existing tasks. Currently only supports updating a task's [`enabled` value](/docs/nia/configuration#enabled-4).

| Method | Path                | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PATCH`  | `/tasks/:task_name` | `application/json` |

#### Request Parameters

* `run` - (string) Values can be only be "inspect" and "now".
  * "inspect": Does not update the task but returns information on if/how resources would be changed for the proposed task update.
  * "now": Updates the task accordingly and immediately runs the task, rather than allowing the task to run at the natural daemon cadence

#### Response Fields

* `inspect` - Information on how resources would be changed given a proposed task update, similar to [inspect-mode](/docs/nia/cli#inspect-mode). This is only returned when passed the `run=inspect` request parameter
  * `changes_present` - (bool) Whether or not changes were detected for running the proposed task update
  * `plan` - (string) The Terraform plan generated for the proposed task update . Note: a non-empty string does not necessarily indicate changes were detected.


#### Example: Disable a task

Request:
```shell-session
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{"enabled":false}' \
  localhost:8558/v1/tasks/task_a
```

Response:
```json
{}
```

#### Example: Inspect enabling a task

Request:
```shell-session
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{"enabled":true}' \
  localhost:8558/v1/tasks/task_a?run=inspect
```

Response if no changes present:
```json
{
  "changes_present": false,
  "plan": "No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date. <truncated>"
}
```

Response if changes present:
```json
{
  "changes_present": true,
  "plan": "<terraform plan truncated> Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy."
}
```
