# Health

The `/health` endpoint returns a successful response if Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) is available and running. Requests to this endpoint are not logged, which makes it suitable for health checks that constantly poll CTS.

| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/health` | `application/json` |
