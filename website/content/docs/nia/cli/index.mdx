# Consul-Terraform-Sync Command (CLI)

Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) is controlled via an easy to use command-line interface (CLI). CTS is only a single command-line application: `consul-terraform-sync`. CTS can be run as a daemon and execute CLI commands. When CTS is run as a daemon, it acts as a server to the CLI commands. Users can use the commands to interact and modify the daemon as it is running. The complete list of commands is in the navigation to the left. Both the daemon and commands return a non-zero exit status on error.

## Daemon

~> Running CTS as a daemon without using a command is deprecated in CTS 0.6.0 and will be removed at a much later date in a major release. For information on the preferred way to run CTS as a daemon see the [`start` command docs](/docs/nia/cli/start)

When running as a daemon, there is no default configuration to run CTS in a meaningful way. Setting a configuration flag `-config-file` or `-config-dir` is required. For example:

```shell-session
$ consul-terraform-sync -config-file=config.hcl
```

To view a list of available flags, use the `-help` or `-h` flag.

Flag: `-inspect-task [task-name]`

Behavior: This has similar behavior as `-inspect` mode for the selected task. The flag can be specified multiple times to inspect multiple tasks. No changes are applied in this mode.

Usage: Useful to debug one or more tasks to confirm configuration is accurate and the selected tasks would update network infrastructure as expected.

#### Once Mode

Flag: `-once`

Behavior: CTS will run all tasks once with buffer periods disabled and exit. On encountering an error before completing, CTS will exit with a non-zero status.

Usage: Intended to be run before long-running mode in order to confirm configuration is accurate and tasks update network infrastructure as expected.

## Commands

In addition to running the daemon, CTS has a set of commands that act as a client to the daemon server. The commands provide a user-friendly experience interacting with the daemon. The commands use the CTS APIs but does not correspond one-to-one with it. Please see the individual commands in the left navigation for more details.

To get help for a command, run: `consul-terraform-sync <command> -h`

### CLI Structure

CTS commands follow the below structure

```shell-session
consul-terraform-sync <command> [options] [args]
```

- `options`: Flags to specify additional settings. There are general options that can be used across all commands and command-specific options.
- `args`: Required arguments specific to a commands

Example:

```shell-session
consul-terraform-sync task disable -http-addr=http://localhost:2000 task_a
```

## Autocompletion

The `consul-terraform-sync` command features opt-in autocompletion for flags, subcommands, and
arguments (where supported).

Enable autocompletion by running:

```shell-session
$ consul-terraform-sync -autocomplete-install
```

~> Be sure to **restart your shell** after installing autocompletion!

When you start typing a CTS command, press the `<tab>` character to show a
list of available completions. Type `-<tab>` to show available flag completions.

If the `CTS_*` environment variables are set, the autocompletion will
automatically query the running CTS server and return helpful argument suggestions.

### General Options

Below are options that can be used across all commands:
