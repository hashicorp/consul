# Register services into a namespace

This page describes how to to register a service into a particular Consul namespace.

@include 'alerts/enterprise-alert.mdx'

<Tip>

Consul Community Edition supports some of the functions listed in this page with its `default` partition and `default` namespace.

## Introduction

Namespaces allow multiple teams within an organization to share one or more Consul datacenters by separating the services, [Consul KV data](/consul/docs/automate/kv), and other Consul data of each team. This allows operators to more easily provide Consul as a service and enables them to [delegate ACL management](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/vm/delegate-token-management).

As of version `1.7`, Consul registers each service in the `default` namespace unless the configuration for the service specifies another namespace. If you do not specify a namespace during service registration, Consul registers the service into the `default` namespace.

## Register a service into a namespace

You register a service into a namespace by using one of the following methods:

- Add the `namespace` attribute to the service registration file.
- Add the `-namespace` flag to the API call or CLI command during service registration.
- Use namespace inheritance using a namespace token.

To migrate an existing service into a new namespace, register the service again and provide the namespace with either method shown.

### Use the `namespace` attribute

Include a `namespace` attribute in the service registration file and set the value to a namespace that exists. Refer to the [Service definition reference page](/consul/docs/reference/service) for more information about registering services with the `service` block.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="db-service.hcl" highlight="4">

```hcl
service {
  name = "db-service"
  port = 5432
  namespace = "db-team"

  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Register the service with Consul by providing the service registration file.

```shell-session
$ consul services register db-service.hcl
Registered service: db-service
```

### Use the `-namespace` flag

Include the `-namespace` flag when registering the service via the Consul CLI.

Refer to the [CLI reference page for the `services register` command](/consul/commands/services/register) for more information and additional configuration options.

```shell-session
$ consul services register \
  -name=db-service \
  -port=5432 \
  -namespace=db-team
```

### Use namespace inheritance

A token's namespace can be inherited during CLI and API requests related to services, intentions, Consul KV, checks, and ACLs. This means that if you register a service with a token in the `db-team` namespace, the service will be registered in that namespace without having to specify it explicitly.

You can create a namespace token following instructions in [Delegate ACL token management with namespaces](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace/vm/delegate-token-management#create-a-developer-token).

First set the token for the CLI.

```shell-session
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=<db-team namespace token here>
```

Then register the service without including the `-namespace` flag.

```shell-session
consul services register -name=db-service -port=5432
Registered service: db-service
```

<Note>

Services registered with service definition configuration files must
have both the ACL token and namespace name defined in the [service definition configuration file](/consul/docs/reference/service),
as these files are parsed prior to resolving the token.

</Note>

## Specify namespace in a Consul DNS query

Queries to Consul DNS can include datacenter or datacenter _and_ namespace.
