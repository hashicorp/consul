# Service Sync annotations and labels

The following Kubernetes resource annotations could be used on a pod to [Service Sync](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/service-sync) behavior:

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-sync`: If this is set to `true`, then the Kubernetes service is explicitly configured to be synced to Consul.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/service-sync': 'true'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-port`: Configures the port to register to the Consul Catalog for the Kubernetes service. The annotation value may be a name of a port (recommended) or an exact port value. Refer to [service ports](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/service-sync#service-ports) for more information.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/service-port': 'http'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags`: A comma separated list of strings (without whitespace) to use for registering tags to the service registered to Consul. These custom tags automatically include the `k8s` tag which can't be disabled.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags': 'primary,foo'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-KEY`: A map for specifying service metadata for Consul services. The "KEY" below can be set to any key. This allows you to set multiple meta values.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-KEY': 'value'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-weight:` - Configures ability to support weighted loadbalancing by service annotation for Catalog Sync. The integer provided will be applied as a weight for the `passing` state for the health of the service. Refer to [weights](/consul/docs/reference/service#weights) in service configuration for more information on how this is leveraged for services in the Consul catalog.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-weight: 10
  ```
