# Consul API gateway use cases

@include 'text/descriptions/api-gateway.mdx'

API gateways solve the following primary use cases:

- **Control access at the point of entry**: Set the protocols of external connection requests and secure inbound connections with TLS certificates from trusted providers, such as Verisign and Let's Encrypt.
- **Simplify traffic management**: Load balance requests across services and route traffic to the appropriate service by matching one or more criteria, such as hostname, path, header presence or value, and HTTP method.

## Consul compared to other API gateways

**Examples**: Kong Gateway, Apigee, Mulesoft, Gravitee 

The [Consul API Gateway](/consul/docs/api-gateway) is an implementation of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). Traditionally, API gateways are used for two things: _client traffic management_ and _API lifecycle management_.

Client traffic management refers to an API gateway's role in controlling the point of entry for public traffic into a given environment, also known as _managing north-south traffic_. The Consul API Gateway is deployed alongside Consul service mesh and is responsible for routing inbound client requests to the mesh based on defined routes. For a full list of supported traffic management features, refer to the [Consul API Gateway documentation](/consul/docs/api-gateway).

API lifecycle management refers to how application developers use an API gateway to deploy, iterate, and manage versions of an API. At this time, the Consul API Gateway does not support API lifecycle management.
