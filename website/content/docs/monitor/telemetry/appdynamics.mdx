# Monitor Consul with AppDynamics CNS

This page describes the process to monitor Consul telemetry data with the Consul monitoring extension for AppDynamics CNS.

## Overview

Consul produces a range of metrics in various formats, which enables operators 
to measure the health and stability of a datacenter, and diagnose or predict 
potential issues.

This tutorial will show you how to use the 
[HashiCorp Consul Monitoring Extension](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-appd-extension)
for AppDynamics CNS to collect Consul telemetry data and node information.

The integration enables you to collect information about 
[HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Consul](/consul/tutorials/get-started-hcp/hcp-gs-deploy) 
environments through Consul client agents.  AppDynamics CNS is also 
[HCP Consul Verified](/hcp/docs/consul).
You will install [AppDynamics Machine Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Infrastructure+Visibility) 
on the Consul agents and use [statsite](https://github.com/statsite/statsite) as 
a metrics aggregator to collect node telemetry metrics.

The extension provides you with two example dashboards that will be imported 
into your AppDynamics controller.

## Prerequisites and configuration

In order to complete this tutorial the following prerequisites need to be satisfied:

- A running Consul or [HCP Consul](/consul/tutorials/get-started-hcp/hcp-gs-deploy) datacenter to monitor with AppDynamics.
- An AppDynamics SaaS or On-Prem controller version 4.5 or greater.
- The Consul agents that are being monitored will also need to meet AppDynamics
  Machine Agent [requirements and supported environments](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Standalone+Machine+Agent+Requirements+and+Supported+Environments).

## Setup monitoring

You will perform the integration in four steps:

- Install AppDynamics Machine Agent including the JRE on the Consul nodes.
- Install HashiCorp Consul Monitoring Extension for AppDynamics CNS.
- Build and install statsite (which is a metrics aggregator like statsd) to collect node metrics.
- Configure Consul to send telemetry data to the AppDynamics agent.

### Install AppDynamics Machine Agent bundle

To integrate your Consul datacenter with AppDynamics you will install and 
configure the AppDynamics Machine Agent on all the nodes you want to monitor and 
configure Consul to send telemetry data to it.

1. Download the AppDynamics [Machine Agent Bundle](https://download.appdynamics.com/download/#version=&apm=machine&os=&platform_admin_os=&appdynamics_cluster_os=&events=&eum=&page=1).

2. As `root` or super user, unzip and setup the service file.

   ```shell-session
   $ sudo su
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ unzip ./machineagent-bundle-64bit-linux-4.5.15.2316.zip -d /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ cp /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/etc/systemd/system/appdynamics-machine-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/appdynamics-machine-agent.service
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

   -> An official installation guide is available on the [AppDynamics documentation website](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Linux+Install+Using+ZIP+with+Bundled+JRE)

3. Configure the AppDynamics Machine Agent to communicate with the controller
   when running in standalone mode.

   ```shell-session
   $ cd /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/conf
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ vi controller-info.xml
   ```

   Note, this requires editing the controller file `controller-info.xml`. You 
   will need to obtain your AppDynamics Controller access information and
   configure it in `controller-info.xml` file before you begin the steps below.
   Refer to [configure the Standalone Machine Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Configure+the+Standalone+Machine+Agent) for the configuration reference.

4. It is highly recommended to increase the value of `maxMetrics` so that data
   doesn't get truncated. Add Java options in AppDynamics agent service
   definition to increase the value of `maxMetrics`.

   ```shell-session
   $ sed -i 's/#Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-D<sys-property1>=<value1> -D<sys-property2>=<value2>"/Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Dappdynamics.agent.maxMetrics=10000"/g' /etc/systemd/system/appdynamics-machine-agent.service
   ```

### Configure AppDynamics machine agent for Consul telemetry

Now that the agent is configured you can install the monitoring extension for
AppDynamics CNS.

Clone the [consul-appd-extension repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-appd-extension) and copy the contents of folder
`statsite` into `/opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/monitors/StatSite`:

```git
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-appd-extension.git
Cloning into 'consul-appd-extension'...
...
```

```shell-session
$ ls -1 ./consul-appd-extension/statsite/
monitor.xml
output.py
statsite.conf
statsite.sh
```

```shell-session
$ mkdir -p /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/monitors/StatSite
```

```shell-session
$ cp ./consul-appd-extension/statsite/* /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/monitors/StatSite
```

### Compile and install statsite

The extension uses statsite to import statsd Consul metrics into AppDynamics. To 
achieve this, it will need a statsite executable embedded in the agent folder. 
This following sections demonstrate how to build statsite for your nodes.

~> Due to the amount of dependencies necessary to successfully build statsite it 
is recommended to perform the build activity on a machine different from the
Consul agents to avoid dependency issues or installing un-necessary software on 
the nodes. Once the build is completed you can distribute the binary to the
Consul nodes to perform the integration.

#### Install dependencies

This tutorial provides you with commands to perform the build for different Linux
flavors but you should refer to the official 
[statsite installation guide](https://github.com/statsite/statsite/blob/master/INSTALL.md) 
to find the best set of steps for your OS.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Debian based OS">

```shell-session
$ apt-get update
```

```shell-session
$ apt-get -y install build-essential libtool autoconf automake scons python-setuptools lsof git texlive check
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Red Hat based OS">

```shell-session
$ yum update
```

```shell-session
$ yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
```

```shell-session
$ yum install -y install libtool autoconf automake scons python-setuptools lsof git texlive check
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Compile

```shell-session
$ cd ~ && wget https://github.com/statsite/statsite/archive/v0.8.0.zip
```

```shell-session
$ unzip v0.8.0.zip && cd statsite-0.8.0
```

```shell-session
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

```shell-session
$ ./configure
```

```shell-session
$ make
```

#### Install

The installation will require you to copy the `statsite` executable into
`/opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/monitors/StatSite` for every node you want to
monitor.

```shell-session
$ cp ./src/statsite /opt/appdynamics/machine-agent/monitors/StatSite
```

### Configure Consul to send metrics to statsite

The last step in the integration is to configure your Consul agents to send 
their telemetry data to AppDynamics CNS via statsite.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL">

<CodeBlockConfig filename="consul-statsite.hcl">

```hcl
telemetry {
  dogstatsd_addr = "localhost:8125"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can apply it to Consul by copying the file into your Consul configuration
folder and then by performing a rolling restart of all the nodes that will use
the integration.

```shell-session
$ cp ./consul-statsite.hcl /etc/consul.d/
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="JSON">

The extension repository provides you with a configuration file already set to
use the statsite instance you embedded in AppDynamics machine agent bundle.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="consul-statsite.json">

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "statsite_address": "localhost:8125"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can apply it to Consul by copying the file into your Consul configuration
folder and then by performing a rolling restart of all the nodes that will use
the integration.

```shell-session
$ cp ./consul-appd-extension/consul-statsite.json /etc/consul.d/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Display telemetry Metrics

For a complete list of Consul metrics supported by these integrations, as well 
as details on what each metric means, consult the Consul
[telemetry documentation](/consul/docs/reference/agent/telemetry).

<Note>

 The AppDynamics Integration with HCP Consul collects a subset of 
Consul's default metrics that do not pertain to [server health](/consul/docs/reference/agent/telemetry#server-health).

</Note>

### Finding metrics

All metrics reported by the extension will be available in the Metric Browser
at `Controller > Applications > Application > Metric Browser`.

- `Application Infrastructure Performance > Consul > Custom Metrics > statsd > consul`
  lists the available Consul metrics:

![AppDynamics CNS Custom Metrics Consul](/img/consul/cloud-integrations/appdynamics-ui-available-metrics-consul.png)

- `Application Infrastructure Performance > Consul > Custom Metrics > statsd > envoy`
  lists metrics available for the Connect service mesh.

![AppDynamics CNS Custom Metrics Service Mesh ](/img/consul/cloud-integrations/appdynamics-ui-available-metrics-service-mesh.png)

### Custom dashboard

The extension repository provides two custom dashboards to get you started on 
monitoring Consul. They are located in the `dashboards` folder.

```shell-session
$ ls -1 ./dashboards
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
consul_dashboard.json
consul_servicemesh_dashboard.json
```

To import the dashboards:

1. Log into your AppDynamics controller. Select the `Dashboards & Reports tab > Dashboards > Import`.
1. Upload the `.json` dashboard file.

Once uploaded the dashboards will be available in the `Dashboard & Reports tab`.

![AppDynamics CNS Custom Dashboard Service Mesh Metrics](/img/consul/cloud-integrations/appdynamics-ui-dashboard-service-mesh.png)

<Note>

 You will need to change the value for the key `applicationName` 
within the templates to match your application name.

</Note>

### Custom health rules

AppDynamics CNS provides the ability to customize health rules, the policy
statements that define triggers. Health rules for Consul are created
against the applications that are using its service discovery and service mesh
so that the metrics for the application as well as Consul can be seen against
particular applications in AppDynamics.

## Next steps

In this tutorial you learned how to integrate AppDynamics machine agent with
Consul and HCP Consul to collect metrics and import custom dashboards into 
AppDynamics CNS to have a monitoring starting point and consider your options 
for visualizing, aggregating, and alerting on those metrics.

For more information on how to personalize your dashboards you can refer to
AppDynamics documentation for [creating custom dashboards](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Custom+Dashboards).
