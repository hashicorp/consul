# Store and access key/value data

This page describes the processes for interacting with Consul's KV store. You can interact with the KV store using the [`consul kv` CLI command](/consul/commands/kv) or the [`/kv` endpoint](/consul/api-docs/kv).

## Add data to KV store

To insert values into the KV store or update an existing value, use the `consul kv put` command. The first entry after the command is the key and the second entry is the value.

```shell-session
$ consul kv put redis/config/minconns 1
Success! Data written to: redis/config/minconns
```

In the following example, the key is `redis/config/maxconns` and the value is set to `25`.

```shell-session
$ consul kv put redis/config/maxconns 25
Success! Data written to: redis/config/maxconns
```

In the following example, the command includes a `flags` value of 42. Keys support setting a 64-bit integer flag value that is not used internally by Consul but can be used by clients to add metadata to a KV pair.

```shell-session
$ consul kv put -flags=42 redis/config/users/admin zaphod
Success! Data written to: redis/config/users/admin
```

## Query data from KV store

To query for the value of one of the keys in the KV store, use the `consul kv get` command.

```shell-session
$ consul kv get redis/config/minconns
1
```

To retrieve metadata you included as `flags`, using the `-detailed` command line flag.

```shell-session
$ consul kv get -detailed redis/config/users/admin
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
CreateIndex      14
Flags            42
Key              redis/config/users/admin
LockIndex        0
ModifyIndex      14
Session          -
Value            zaphod
```

To list all the keys in the store, use the `recurse` option. Results return in lexicographical order.

```shell-session
$ consul kv get -recurse
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
redis/config/maxconns:25
redis/config/minconns:1
redis/config/users/admin:zaphod
```

## Delete data

To delete the value of one of the keys in the KV store, use the `consul kv delete` command.

```shell-session
$ consul kv delete redis/config/minconns
Success! Deleted key: redis/config/minconns
```

Although the keys in the KV store are stored in a flat structure, you can manipulate keys that share a prefix as a group, as if they were in folders or subfolders, by using the `-recurse` flag.

The following example deletes all the keys with the `redis` prefix using the `-recurse` option.

```shell-session
$ consul kv delete -recurse redis
Success! Deleted keys with prefix: redis
```
