# Dynamically configure applications

This topic provides an overview for dynamically configuring applications when Consul detects certain changes in your network. Many of these operations rely on Consul's key/value (KV)store.

For information about automatically deploying infrastructure when Consul detects failed health checks or increased network traffic, refer to [Consul-Terraform-Sync](/consul/docs/automate/infrastructure).

## Introduction

Platform operators managing a Consul deployment at scale require automated processes for generating and distributing updated configurations dynamically as applications change. You can use Consul's KV store to store data for generating Consul agent configurations, and set up the agent to invoke custom scripts in response to changes.
