# Advertise address parameters for Consul agent configuration files

The page provides reference information for address advertisement parameters in a Consul agent configuration file.

## Advertise Address Parameters

- `advertise_addr` ((#\_advertise)) - The advertise address is used to change
  the address advertised to other nodes in the cluster. By default, the bind
  address is advertised. However, in some cases, there may be a routable address
  that cannot be bound. This parameter enables gossiping a different address to support
  this. If this address is not routable, the node will be in a constant flapping
  state as other nodes will treat the non-routability as a failure. In Consul v1.1.0 and later this can be dynamically defined with a [go-sockaddr]
  template that is resolved at runtime. Equivalent to the [`-advertise` command-line flag](/consul/commands/agent#_advertise).

- `advertise_addr_ipv4` - This was added together with [`advertise_addr_ipv6`](#advertise_addr_ipv6) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_ipv6` - This was added together with [`advertise_addr_ipv4`](#advertise_addr_ipv4) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_wan` ((#\_advertise-wan)) - The advertise WAN address is used
  to change the address that we advertise to server nodes joining through the WAN.
  This can also be set on client agents when used in combination with the [`translate_wan_addrs`](/consul/docs/reference/agent#translate_wan_addrs) configuration option. By default, the [`advertise_addr`](#_advertise) address
  is advertised. However, in some cases all members of all datacenters cannot be
  on the same physical or virtual network, especially on hybrid setups mixing cloud
  and private datacenters. This flag enables server nodes gossiping through the public
  network for the WAN while using private VLANs for gossiping to each other and their
  client agents, and it allows client agents to be reached at this address when being
  accessed from a remote datacenter if the remote datacenter is configured with [`translate_wan_addrs`](/consul/docs/reference/agent#translate_wan_addrs). In Consul 1.1.0 and later this can be dynamically defined with a [go-sockaddr]
  template that is resolved at runtime. Equivalent to the [`-advertise-wan` command-line flag](/consul/commands/agent#_advertise-wan).

- `advertise_addr_wan_ipv4` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_wan_ipv6`](#advertise_addr_wan_ipv6) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_wan_ipv6` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_wan_ipv4`](#advertise_addr_wan_ipv4) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_reconnect_timeout` This is a per-agent setting of the [`reconnect_timeout`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/general#reconnect_timeout) parameter.
  This agent will advertise to all other nodes in the cluster that after this timeout, the node may be completely
  removed from the cluster. This may only be set on client agents and if unset then other nodes will use the main
  `reconnect_timeout` setting when determining when this node may be removed
  from the cluster.
