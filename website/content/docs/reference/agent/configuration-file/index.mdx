# Consul agents configuration file reference

This topic describes the parameters for configuring Consul agents.

Refer to the [Configure a Consul agent](/consul/docs/fundamentals/agent) guide for information on the following:

- Configuration files location
- Common configuration settings
- Reloadable configurations
- Starting and stopping a Consul agent

## Overview

Create one or more files to configure the Consul agent on startup. We recommend
grouping similar configurations, such as ACL parameters, into separate files to
better manage configuration changes.

Write configuration files in HCL or JSON. Both humans and computers can read and
edit JSON configuration files. JSON configuration consists of a single JSON
object with multiple configuration keys specified within it.

```hcl
datacenter = "east-aws"
data_dir = "/opt/consul"
log_level = "INFO"
node_name = "foobar"
server = true
watches = [
  {
    type = "checks"
    handler = "/usr/bin/health-check-handler.sh"
  }
]

telemetry {
  statsite_address = "127.0.0.1:2180"
}
```

```json
{
  "datacenter": "east-aws",
  "data_dir": "/opt/consul",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "node_name": "foobar",
  "server": true,
  "watches": [
    {
      "type": "checks",
      "handler": "/usr/bin/health-check-handler.sh"
    }
  ],
  "telemetry": {
    "statsite_address": "127.0.0.1:2180"
  }
}
```

### Time-to-live values

Consul uses the Go `time` package to parse all time-to-live (TTL) values used in Consul agent configuration files. Specify integer and float values as a string and include one or more of the following units of time:

- `ns`
- `us`
- `Âµs`
- `ms`
- `s`
- `m`
- `h`

Examples:

- `'300ms'`
- `'1.5h'`
- `'2h45m'`

Refer to the [formatting specification](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) for additional information.

#### Duration validation

When configuring timeout and duration values, Consul validates the format and enforces minimum values where applicable. Invalid duration strings will cause the agent to fail to start with a descriptive error message.

**Valid examples:**
- `"10s"` - 10 seconds
- `"1.5m"` - 1.5 minutes (90 seconds)
- `"2h30m45s"` - Complex duration with hours, minutes, and seconds
- `"0s"` - Zero duration (where allowed)

**Invalid examples that will cause errors:**
- `"10"` - Missing unit specification
- `"10x"` - Invalid unit (`x` is not a recognized unit)
- `""` - Empty string
- `"abc"` - Non-numeric string
- `"-5s"` - Negative durations (not accepted for timeout configurations)

**Minimum value enforcement:** Some timeout configurations enforce minimum values to prevent misconfigurations that could cause connection issues or security vulnerabilities. For example, handshake timeouts typically require a minimum of 1 second. When a configured value is below the minimum, Consul will report a validation error during startup.

## Examples

The following configuration examples demonstrate scenarios for server and client agent configuration files.

@include 'examples/agent/server/encrypted.mdx'

@include 'examples/agent/server/service-mesh.mdx'

@include 'examples/agent/client/multi-interface.mdx'

@include 'examples/agent/client/register-service.mdx'
