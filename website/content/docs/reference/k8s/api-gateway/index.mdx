# Consul API gateway configuration reference overview

This topic provides an overview of the configuration items you can use to create API gateways, configure listeners, define routes, and apply additional resources that may be necessary to operate Consul API gateways in your environment. 

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Consul on Kubernetes

Apply the following configuration items if your network runs on Kubernetes:

| Configuration | Description | Usage |
| ---  | ---         | ---   |
| [`Gateway`](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/configuration/gateway) | Defines the main infrastructure resource for declaring an API gateway and listeners on the gateway. It also specifies the name of the `GatewayClass`. | [Deploy listeners on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/deploy/listeners-k8s) |
| [`GatewayClass`](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclass) | Defines a class of gateway resources used as a template for creating gateways. The default gateway class is `consul` and is suitable for most API gateway implementations.  | [Deploy listeners on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/deploy/listeners-k8s) |
| [`GatewayClassConfig`](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/configuration/gatewayclassconfig) | Describes additional gateway-related configuration parameters for the `GatewayClass` resource. | [Deploy listeners on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/deploy/listeners-k8s) |
| [`Routes`](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/configuration/routes) | Specifies paths from the gateway listener to backend services. | <nobr>[Define routes on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/define-routes/routes-k8s)</nobr><p>[Reroute traffic in Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/define-routes/reroute-http-requests)</p><p>[Route traffic to peered services in Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/define-routes/route-to-peered-services)</p> |
| [`MeshServices`](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/configuration/meshservices) | Enables routes to reference services in Consul. | [Route traffic to peered services in Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/define-routes/route-to-peered-services) |
| [`ServiceIntentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) | Specifies traffic communication rules between services in the mesh. Intentions also enforce rules for service-to-service traffic routed through a Consul API gateway. | General configuration for securing a service mesh |
