# Telemetry

The Consul agent collects various runtime metrics about the performance of
different libraries and subsystems. These metrics are aggregated on a ten
second (10s) interval and are retained for one minute. An _interval_ is the period of time between instances of data being collected and aggregated.

When telemetry is being streamed to an external metrics store, the interval is defined to be that store's flush interval.

|External Store|Interval (seconds)|
|:--------|:--------|
|[dogstatsd](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent#how-it-works)|10s|
|[Prometheus](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/prometheus_exporter/#flush_period_secshttps://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/prometheus_exporter/#flush_period_secs)| 60s|
|[statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md#timing)|10s|

To view this data, you must send a signal to the Consul process: on Unix,
this is `USR1` while on Windows it is `BREAK`. Once Consul receives the signal,
it will dump the current telemetry information to the agent's `stderr`.

This telemetry information can be used for debugging or otherwise
getting a better view of what Consul is doing. Review the [Monitoring and
Metrics tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/monitor-datacenter-health?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs) to learn how collect and interpret Consul data.

Additionally, if the [`telemetry` configuration options](/docs/agent/options#telemetry)
are provided, the telemetry information will be streamed to a
[statsite](http://github.com/armon/statsite) or [statsd](http://github.com/etsy/statsd) server where
it can be aggregated and flushed to Graphite or any other metrics store.
For a configuration example for Telegraf, review the [Monitoring with Telegraf tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/monitor-health-telegraf?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs).

This
information can also be viewed with the [metrics endpoint](/api/agent#view-metrics) in JSON
format or using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format.

# Key Metrics

These are some metrics emitted that can help you understand the health of your cluster at a glance. A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) [dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13396) is also available, which is maintained by the Consul team and displays these metrics for easy visualization. For a full list of metrics emitted by Consul, see [Metrics Reference](#metrics-reference)

### Transaction timing

| Metric Name              | Description                                                                          | Unit                         | Type    |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------ |
| `consul.kvs.apply`       | Measures the time it takes to complete an update to the KV store.               | ms                           | timer   |
| `consul.txn.apply`       | Measures the time spent applying a transaction operation.                       | ms                           | timer   |
| `consul.raft.apply`      | Counts the number of Raft transactions applied during the interval. This metric is only reported on the leader. | raft transactions / interval | counter |
| `consul.raft.commitTime` | Measures the time it takes to commit a new entry to the Raft log on the leader. | ms                           | timer   |

**Why they're important:** Taken together, these metrics indicate how long it takes to complete write operations in various parts of the Consul cluster. Generally these should all be fairly consistent and no more than a few milliseconds. Sudden changes in any of the timing values could be due to unexpected load on the Consul servers, or due to problems on the servers themselves.

**What to look for:** Deviations (in any of these metrics) of more than 50% from baseline over the previous hour.

### Leadership changes

| Metric Name                      | Description                                                                                                    | Unit      | Type    |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------ |
| `consul.raft.leader.lastContact` | Measures the time since the leader was last able to contact the follower nodes when checking its leader lease. | ms        | timer   |
| `consul.raft.state.candidate`    | Increments whenever a Consul server starts an election.                                                   | elections | counter |
| `consul.raft.state.leader`       | Increments whenever a Consul server becomes a leader.                                                     | leaders   | counter |

**Why they're important:** Normally, your Consul cluster should have a stable leader. If there are frequent elections or leadership changes, it would likely indicate network issues between the Consul servers, or that the Consul servers themselves are unable to keep up with the load.

**What to look for:** For a healthy cluster, you're looking for a `lastContact` lower than 200ms, `leader` > 0 and `candidate` == 0. Deviations from this might indicate flapping leadership.

### Autopilot

| Metric Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Unit         | Type  |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---- |
| `consul.autopilot.healthy` | Tracks the overall health of the local server cluster. If all servers are considered healthy by Autopilot, this will be set to 1. If any are unhealthy, this will be 0. All non-leader servers will report `NaN`. | health state | gauge |

**Why it's important:** Autopilot can expose the overall health of your cluster with a simple boolean.

**What to look for:** Alert if `healthy` is 0. Some other indicators of an unhealthy cluster would be:
- `consul.raft.commitTime` - This can help reflect the speed of state store
changes being performed by the agent. If this number is rising, the server may
be experiencing an issue due to degraded resources on the host.
- [Leadership change metrics](#leadership-changes) - Check for deviation from
the recommended values. This can indicate failed leadership elections or
flapping nodes.

### Memory usage

| Metric Name                  | Description                                                        | Unit  | Type  |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- | :---- |
| `consul.runtime.alloc_bytes` | Measures the number of bytes allocated by the Consul process. | bytes | gauge |
| `consul.runtime.sys_bytes`   | Measures the total number of bytes of memory obtained from the OS.  | bytes | gauge |

**Why they're important:** Consul keeps all of its data in memory. If Consul consumes all available memory, it will crash.

**What to look for:** If `consul.runtime.sys_bytes` exceeds 90% of total available system memory.

**NOTE:** This metric is calculated using Go's runtime package
[MemStats](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats). This will have a
different output than using information gathered from `top`. For more
information, see [GH-4734](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/4734).

### Garbage collection

| Metric Name                        | Description                                                                                           | Unit | Type  |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--- | :---- |
| `consul.runtime.total_gc_pause_ns` | Number of nanoseconds consumed by stop-the-world garbage collection (GC) pauses since Consul started. | ns   | gauge |

**Why it's important:** GC pause is a "stop-the-world" event, meaning that all runtime threads are blocked until GC completes. Normally these pauses last only a few nanoseconds. But if memory usage is high, the Go runtime may GC so frequently that it starts to slow down Consul.

**What to look for:** Warning if `total_gc_pause_ns` exceeds 2 seconds/minute, critical if it exceeds 5 seconds/minute.

**NOTE:** `total_gc_pause_ns` is a cumulative counter, so in order to calculate rates (such as GC/minute),
you will need to apply a function such as InfluxDB's [`non_negative_difference()`](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/query_language/functions/#non-negative-difference).

### Network activity - RPC Count

| Metric Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Unit     | Type    |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| `consul.client.rpc`          | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server                                                                                         | requests | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.exceeded` | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server gets rate limited by that agent's [`limits`](/docs/agent/options#limits) configuration. | requests | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.failed`   | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server and fails.                                                                              | requests | counter |

**Why they're important:** These measurements indicate the current load created from a Consul agent, including when the load becomes high enough to be rate limited. A high RPC count, especially from `consul.client.rpcexceeded` meaning that the requests are being rate-limited, could imply a misconfigured Consul agent.

**What to look for:**
Sudden large changes to the `consul.client.rpc` metrics (greater than 50% deviation from baseline).
`consul.client.rpc.exceeded` or `consul.client.rpc.failed` count > 0, as it implies that an agent is being rate-limited or fails to make an RPC request to a Consul server

### Raft Replication Capacity Issues

| Metric Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Unit     | Type    |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------ |
| `consul.raft.fsm.lastRestoreDuration`               | Measures the time taken to restore the FSM from a snapshot on an agent restart or from the leader calling installSnapshot. This is a gauge that holds it's value since most servers only restore during restarts which are typically infrequent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ms                                | gauge   |
| `consul.raft.leader.oldestLogAge`                   | The number of milliseconds since the _oldest_ log in the leader's log store was written. This can be important for replication health where write rate is high and the snapshot is large as followers may be unable to recover from a restart if restoring takes longer than the minimum value for the current leader. Compare this with `consul.raft.fsm.lastRestoreDuration` and `consul.raft.rpc.installSnapshot` to monitor. In normal usage this gauge value will grow linearly over time until a snapshot completes on the leader and the log is truncated.                                                                                             | ms                                | gauge   |
| `consul.raft.rpc.installSnapshot`                   | Measures the time taken to process the installSnapshot RPC call. This metric should only be seen on agents which are currently in the follower state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ms                                | timer   |

**Why they're important:** These metrics allow operators to monitor the health
and capacity of raft replication on servers. **When Consul is handling large
amounts of data and high write throughput** it is possible for the cluster to
get into the following state:
 * Write throughput is high (say 500 commits per second or more) and constant
 * The leader is writing out a large snapshot every minute or so
 * The snapshot is large enough that it takes considerable time to restore from
   disk on a restart or from the leader if a follower gets behind
 * Disk IO available allows the leader to write a snapshot faster than it can be
   restored from disk on a follower

Under these conditions, a follower after a restart may be unable to catch up on
replication and become a voter again since it takes longer to restore from disk
or the leader than the leader takes to write a new snapshot and truncate its
logs. Servers retain
[`raft_trailing_logs`](/docs/agent/options#_raft_trailing_logs) (default
`10240`) log entries even if their snapshot was more recent. On a leader
processing 500 commits/second, that is only about 20 seconds worth of logs.
Assuming the leader is able to write out a snapshot and truncate the logs in
less than 20 seconds, there will only be 20 seconds worth of "recent" logs
available on the leader right after the leader has taken a snapshot and never
more than about 80 seconds worth assuming it is taking a snapshot and truncating
logs every 60 seconds.

In this state, followers must be able to restore a snapshot into memory and
resume replication in under 80 seconds otherwise they will never be able to
rejoin the cluster until write rates reduce. If they take more than 20 seconds
then there will be a chance that they are unlucky with timing when they restart
and have to download a snapshot again from the servers one or more times. If
they take 50 seconds or more then they will likely fail to catch up more often
than they succeed and will remain non-voters for some time until they happen to
complete the restore just before the leader truncates its logs.

In the worst case, the follower will be left continually downloading snapshots
from the leader which are always too old to use by the time they are restored.
This can put additional strain on the leader transferring large snapshots
repeatedly as well as reduce the fault tolerance and serving capacity of the
cluster.

Since Consul 1.5.3
[`raft_trailing_logs`](/docs/agent/options#_raft_trailing_logs) has been
configurable. Increasing it allows the leader to retain more logs and give
followers more time to restore and catch up. The tradeoff is potentially
slower appends which eventually might affect write throughput and latency
negatively so setting it arbitrarily high is not recommended. Before Consul
1.10.0 it required a rolling restart to change this configuration on the leader
though and since no followers could restart without loosing health this could
mean loosing cluster availability and needing to recover the cluster from a loss
of quorum.

Since Consul 1.10.0
[`raft_trailing_logs`](/docs/agent/options#_raft_trailing_logs) is now
reloadable with `consul reload` or `SIGHUP` allowing operators to increase this
without the leader restarting or loosing leadership allowing the cluster to be
recovered gracefully.

Monitoring these metrics can help avoid or diagnose this state.

**What to look for:**

`consul.raft.leader.oldestLogAge` should look like a saw-tooth wave increasing
linearly with time until the leader takes a snapshot and then jumping down as
the oldest logs are truncated. The lowest point on that line should remain
comfortably higher (i.e. 2x or more) than the time it takes to restore a
snapshot.

There are two ways a snapshot can be restored on a follower: from disk on
startup or from the leader during an `installSnapshot` RPC. The leader only
sends an `installSnapshot` RPC if the follower is new and has no state, or if
it's state is too old for it to catch up with the leaders logs.

`consul.raft.fsm.lastRestoreDuration` shows the time it took to restore from
either source the last time it happened. Most of the time this is when the
server was started. It's a gauge that will always show the last restore duration
(in Consul 1.10.0 and later) however long ago that was.

`consul.raft.rpc.installSnapshot` is the timing information from the leader's
perspective when it installs a new snapshot on a follower. It includes the time
spent transferring the data as well as the follower restoring it. Since these
events are typically infrequent, you may need to graph the last value observed,
for example using `max_over_time` with a large range in Prometheus. While the
restore part will also be reflected in `lastRestoreDuration`, it can be useful
to observe this too since the logs need to be able to cover this entire
operation including the snapshot delivery to ensure followers can always catch
up safely.

Graphing `consul.raft.leader.oldestLogAge` on the same axes as the other two
metrics here can help see at a glance if restore times are creeping dangerously
close to the limit of what the leader is retaining at the current write rate.

Note that if servers don't restart often, then the snapshot could have grown
significantly since the last restore happened so last restore times might not
reflect what would happen if an agent restarts now.

### License Expiration <EnterpriseAlert inline />

| Metric Name                       | Description                                                      | Unit  | Type  |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- | :---- |
| `consul.system.licenseExpiration` | Number of hours until the Consul Enterprise license will expire. | hours | gauge |

**Why they're important:**

This measurement indicates how many hours are left before the Consul Enterprise license expires. When the license expires some
Consul Enterprise features will cease to work. An example of this is that after expiration, it is no longer possible to create
or modify resources in non-default namespaces or to manage namespace definitions themselves even though reads of namespaced
resources will still work.

**What to look for:**

This metric should be monitored to ensure that the license doesn't expire to prevent degradation of functionality.


## Metrics Reference

This is a full list of metrics emitted by Consul.

Includes labels for `path` and `method`. `path` does not include details like service or key names, for these an underscore will be present as a placeholder (eg. path=`v1.kv._`)                                                                                                         | ms                   | timer   |
| `consul.client.rpc`                                      | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server. This gives a measure of how much a given agent is loading the Consul servers. Currently, this is only generated by agents in client mode, not Consul servers.                                                                                                                                                            | requests             | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.exceeded`                             | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server gets rate limited by that agent's [`limits`](/docs/agent/options#limits) configuration. This gives an indication that there's an abusive application making too many requests on the agent, or that the rate limit needs to be increased. Currently, this only applies to agents in client mode, not Consul servers.      | rejected requests    | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.failed`                               | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server and fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | requests             | counter |

| `consul.raft.leader.lastContact`                    | Measures the time since the leader was last able to contact the follower nodes when checking its leader lease. It can be used as a measure for how stable the Raft timing is and how close the leader is to timing out its lease.The lease timeout is 500 ms times the [`raft_multiplier` configuration](/docs/agent/options#raft_multiplier), so this telemetry value should not be getting close to that configured value, otherwise the Raft timing is marginal and might need to be tuned, or more powerful servers might be needed. See the [Server Performance](/docs/install/performance) guide for more details. | ms                                | timer   |
| `consul.raft.leader.oldestLogAge`                   | The number of milliseconds since the _oldest_ log in the leader's log store was written. This can be important for replication health where write rate is high and the snapshot is large as followers may be unable to recover from a restart if restoring takes longer than the minimum value for the current leader. Compare this with `consul.raft.fsm.lastRestoreDuration` and `consul.raft.rpc.installSnapshot` to monitor. In normal usage this gauge value will grow linearly over time until a snapshot completes on the leader and the log is truncated. Note: this metric won't be emitted until the leader writes a snapshot. After an upgrade to Consul 1.10.0 it won't be emitted until the oldest log was written after the upgrade. | ms                                | gauge   |

| `consul.memberlist.degraded.probe`    | Counts the number of times the agent has performed failure detection on another agent at a slower probe rate. The agent uses its own health metric as an indicator to perform this action. (If its health score is low, means that the node is healthy, and vice versa.)                                                                                                                                                           | probes / interval                       | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.degraded.timeout`  | Counts the number of times an agent was marked as a dead node, whilst not getting enough confirmations from a randomly selected list of agent nodes in an agent's membership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | occurrence / interval                   | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.msg.dead`          | Counts the number of times an agent has marked another agent to be a dead node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | messages / interval                     | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.health.score`      | Describes a node's perception of its own health based on how well it is meeting the soft real-time requirements of the protocol. This metric ranges from 0 to 8, where 0 indicates "totally healthy". This health score is used to scale the time between outgoing probes, and higher scores translate into longer probing intervals. For more details see section IV of the Lifeguard paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00788.pdf | score                                   | gauge   |
| `consul.memberlist.msg.suspect`       | Increments when an agent suspects another as failed when executing random probes as part of the gossip protocol. These can be an indicator of overloaded agents, network problems, or configuration errors where agents can not connect to each other on the [required ports](/docs/agent/options#ports).                                                                                                                                 | suspect messages received / interval    | counter |

## Connect Built-in Proxy Metrics

Consul Connect's built-in proxy is by default configured to log metrics to the
same sink as the agent that starts it.

When running in this mode it emits some basic metrics. These will be expanded
upon in the future.

All metrics are prefixed with `consul.proxy.<proxied-service-id>` to distinguish
between multiple proxies on a given host. The table below use `web` as an
example service name for brevity.

### Labels

Most labels have a `dst` label and some have a `src` label. When using metrics
sinks and timeseries stores that support labels or tags, these allow aggregating
the connections by service name.

Assuming all services are using a managed built-in proxy, you can get a complete
overview of both number of open connections and bytes sent and received between
all services by aggregating over these metrics.

For example aggregating over all `upstream` (i.e. outbound) connections which
have both `src` and `dst` labels, you can get a sum of all the bandwidth in and
out of a given service or the total number of connections between two services.

### Metrics Reference

The standard go runtime metrics are exported by `go-metrics` as with Consul
agent. The table below describes the additional metrics exported by the proxy.
