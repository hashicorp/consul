### Resiliency

- [Automated Backups](/consul/docs/enterprise/backups): Configure the automatic backup of Consul state
- [Redundancy Zones](/consul/docs/enterprise/redundancy): Deploy backup voting Consul servers to efficiently improve Consul fault tolerance
- [Server request rate limits per source IP](/consul/docs/agent/limits/usage/limit-request-rates-from-ips): Limit gRPC and RPC traffic to servers for source IP addresses.

### Scalability

- [Read Replicas](/consul/docs/enterprise/read-scale): Deploy non-voting Consul servers to enhance the scalability of read requests

### Operational simplification

- [Automated Upgrades](/consul/docs/enterprise/upgrades): Ease upgrades by automating the transition from existing to newly deployed Consul servers
