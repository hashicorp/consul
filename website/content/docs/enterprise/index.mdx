# Consul Enterprise

[Consul Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/)
features address the organizational complexities of collaboration, operations, scale, and governance.
If you have purchased or wish to try out Consul Enterprise,
refer to [how to access Consul Enterprise](#access-consul-enterprise).

## Enterprise features

The following features are [available in several forms of Consul Enterprise](#consul-enterprise-feature-availability).

### Multi-Tenancy

- [Admin Partitions](/consul/docs/segment/admin-partition): Define administrative boundaries between tenants within a single Consul datacenter
- [Namespaces](/consul/docs/segment/namespace): Define resource boundaries within a single admin partition for further organizational flexibility
- [Sameness Groups](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/sameness-group): Define partitions and cluster peers as members of a group with identical services

### Resiliency

- [Automated Backups](/consul/docs/manage-consul/automated-backups): Configure the automatic backup of Consul state
- [Redundancy Zones](/consul/docs/manage-consul/redundancy-zones): Deploy backup voting Consul servers to efficiently improve Consul fault tolerance
- [Server request rate limits per source IP](/consul/docs/manage-consul/agent-rate-limit/source-ip-addresses): Limit gRPC and RPC traffic to servers for source IP addresses.
- [Traffic rate limiting for services](/consul/docs/connect/manage-traffic/limit-request-rates): Limit the rate of HTTP requests a service receives per service instance.  
- [Locality-aware routing](/consul/docs/connect/manage-traffic/route-to-local-upstreams): Prioritize upstream services in the same region and zone as the downstream service.

### Scalability

- [Read Replicas](/consul/docs/manage-consul/read-replicas): Deploy non-voting Consul servers to enhance the scalability of read requests

### Operational simplification

- [Automated Upgrades](/consul/docs/upgrade/automated): Ease upgrades by automating the transition from existing to newly deployed Consul servers
- [Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise](/consul/docs/nia/enterprise): Leverage the enhanced network infrastructure automation capabilities of the enterprise version of Consul-Terraform-Sync

### Complex network topology support

- [Network Areas](/consul/docs/enterprise/federation): Support complex network topologies between federated Consul datacenters with pairwise federation rather than full mesh federation
- [Network Segments](/consul/docs/enterprise/network-segments/network-segments-overview): Support complex network topologies within a Consul datacenter by enforcing boundaries in Consul client gossip traffic

### Governance

- [OIDC Auth Method](/consul/docs/secure-consul/acl/auth-methods/oidc): Manage user access to Consul through an OIDC identity provider instead of Consul ACL tokens directly
- [Audit Logging](/consul/docs/enterprise/audit-logging): Understand Consul access and usage patterns by reviewing access to the Consul HTTP API
- JWT authentication and authorization for API gateway: Prevent unverified traffic at the API gateway using JWTs for authentication and authorization on [VMs](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/secure-traffic/verify-jwts-vms) and on [Kubernetes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/secure-traffic/verify-jwts-k8s):

### Regulatory compliance

- [FIPS 140-2 Compliance](/consul/docs/deploy/server/fips): Leverage FIPS builds of Consul Enterprise to ensure your Consul deployments are secured with BoringCrypto and CNGCrypto, and compliant with FIPS 140-2.

  <Note>

  FIPS 140-2 builds of Consul Enterprise support all runtimes (VMs, Kubernetes) except for Lambda and ECS. In addition, HCP does not currently support FIPS builds of Consul Enterprise.

  </Note>
