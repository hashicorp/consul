# Consul Enterprise

[Consul Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/)
features address the organizational complexities of collaboration, operations, scale, and governance.
If you have purchased or wish to try out Consul Enterprise,
refer to [how to access Consul Enterprise](#access-consul-enterprise).

## Enterprise features

The following features are [available in several forms of Consul Enterprise](#consul-enterprise-feature-availability).

### Multi-Tenancy

- [Admin Partitions](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/admin-partition): Define administrative boundaries between tenants within a single Consul datacenter.
- [Namespaces](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace): Define resource boundaries within a single admin partition for further organizational flexibility.
- [Sameness Groups](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/sameness-group): Define partitions and cluster peers as members of a group with identical services.

### Resiliency

- [Automated Backups](/consul/docs/manage/scale/automated-backup): Configure the automatic backup of Consul state.
- [Redundancy Zones](/consul/docs/manage/scale/redundancy-zone): Deploy backup voting Consul servers to efficiently improve Consul fault tolerance
- [Server request rate limits per source IP](/consul/docs/manage/rate-limit/source): Limit gRPC and RPC traffic to servers for source IP addresses.
- [Traffic rate limiting for services](/consul/docs/manage-traffic/rate-limit): Limit the rate of HTTP requests a service receives per service instance.
- [Locality-aware routing](/consul/docs/manage-traffic/route-local): Prioritize upstream services in the same region and zone as the downstream service.
- [Fault injection](/consul/docs/troubleshoot/fault-injection): Explore the resiliency of downstream services in response to problems with an upstream service, such as errors, latency, or response rate limits.

### Scalability

- [Read Replicas](/consul/docs/manage/scale/read-replica): Deploy non-voting Consul servers to enhance the scalability of read requests.

### Operational simplification

- [Long Term Support (LTS)](/consul/docs/upgrade/lts): Reduce operational overhead and risk by using LTS releases that are maintained for longer than standard releases.
- [Automated Upgrades](/consul/docs/upgrade/automated): Ease upgrades by automating the transition from existing to newly deployed Consul servers.
- [Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise](/consul/docs/enterprise/cts): Leverage the enhanced network infrastructure automation capabilities of the enterprise version of Consul-Terraform-Sync.

### Complex network topology support

- [Network Areas](/consul/docs/east-west/network-area): Support complex network topologies between federated Consul datacenters with pairwise federation rather than full mesh federation.
- [Network Segments](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/network-segment): Support complex network topologies within a Consul datacenter by enforcing boundaries in Consul client gossip traffic.

### Governance

- [OIDC Auth Method](/consul/docs/secure/acl/auth-method/oidc): Manage user access to Consul through an OIDC identity provider instead of Consul ACL tokens directly.
- [Audit Logging](/consul/docs/monitor/log/audit): Understand Consul access and usage patterns by reviewing access to the Consul HTTP API.
- JWT authentication and authorization for API gateway: Prevent unverified traffic at the API gateway using JWTs for authentication and authorization on [VMs](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/secure-traffic/jwt/vm) and on [Kubernetes](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/secure-traffic/jwt/k8s).

### Regulatory compliance

- [FIPS 140-2 Compliance](/consul/docs/deploy/server/fips): Leverage FIPS builds of Consul Enterprise to ensure your Consul deployments are secured with BoringCrypto and CNGCrypto, and compliant with FIPS 140-2.

  <Note>

  FIPS 140-2 builds of Consul Enterprise support all runtimes (VMs, Kubernetes) except for Lambda and ECS. In addition, HCP does not currently support FIPS builds of Consul Enterprise.

  </Note>

## Access Consul Enterprise

The method of accessing Consul Enterprise and its features depends on the whether using
HashiCorp Cloud Platform or self-managed Consul Enterprise.
