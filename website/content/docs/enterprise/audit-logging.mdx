Consul Enterprise v1.8.0 adds audit logging as a feature that captures a clear and actionable log of authenticated events (both attempted and committed) that Consul processes and compiles them into a JSON format for easy export. These events contain a timestamp, the operation performed, and the user who initiated the action.

Audit logging enables security and compliance teams within an organization to get greater insight into Consul access and usage patterns.

For more details, review the [Consul Server Configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options) documentation and the [Audit](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options#audit) configuration.
