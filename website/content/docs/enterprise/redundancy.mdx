description: >-
  Redundancy zones are regions of a cluster containing "hot standby" servers, or non-voting servers that can replace voting servers in the event of a failure. Learn about redundancy zones and how they improve resiliency and increase fault tolerance without affecting latency.

# Redundancy Zones

<EnterpriseAlert>

This feature requires
self-managed Consul Enterprise.
Refer to the [enterprise feature matrix](/consul/docs/enterprise#consul-enterprise-feature-availability) for additional information.

</EnterpriseAlert>

Consul Enterprise redundancy zones provide
both scaling and resiliency benefits by enabling the deployment of non-voting
servers alongside voting servers on a per availability zone basis.

When using redundancy zones, if an operator chooses to deploy Consul across 3 availability zones, they
could have 2 (or more) servers (1 voting/1 non-voting) in each zone. In the event that a voting
member in an availability zone fails, the redundancy zone configuration would automatically
promote the non-voting member to a voting member. In the event that an entire availability
zone was lost, a non-voting member in one of the existing availability zones would promote
to a voting member, keeping server quorum. This capability functions as a "hot standby"
for server nodes while also providing (and expanding) the capabilities of
[enhanced read scalability](/consul/docs/enterprise/read-scale) by also including recovery
capabilities.

and reference the [Consul Autopilot](/consul/commands/operator/autopilot) documentation.
