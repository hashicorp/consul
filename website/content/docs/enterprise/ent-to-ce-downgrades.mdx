  Guide to downgrade from consul enterprise to consul ce

## Introduction

This document describes some best practices that you should follow when
downgrading from Consul Enterprise to Consul CE.

## Download the CE Version

First, download the binary for the CE version you want.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Binary">

All current and past versions of the CE and Enterprise releases are
available here:

- https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Docker">

Docker containers are available at this location:

- **CE:** https://hub.docker.com/_/consul

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Prepare for the Downgrade to CE

**1.** Take a snapshot:

```
consul snapshot save backup.snap
```

You can inspect the snapshot to ensure if was successful with:

```
consul snapshot inspect backup.snap
```

Example output:

```
ID           2-1182-1542056499724
Size         4115
Index        1182
Term         2
Version      1
```

This will ensure you have a safe fallback option in case something goes wrong. Store
this snapshot somewhere safe. More documentation on snapshot usage is available here:

- [consul.io/commands/snapshot](/consul/commands/snapshot)
- [Backup Consul Data and State tutorial](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/backup-and-restore)

**2.** Temporarily modify your Consul configuration so that its [log_level](/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_log_level)
is set to `debug`. After doing this, issue the following command on your servers to
reload the configuration:

```
consul reload
```

This change will give you more information to work with in the event something goes wrong.


**3.** Remove references to tenanted services from service-resolver, service-splitter and service-router config entries.


## Perform the Downgrade

- Restart or redeploy all clients with a CE version of the binary

- Update server binaries to use the CE version

- Restart or redeploy the servers one at a time with an env var named `CONSUL_ENTERPRISE_DOWNGRADE_TO_CE` set to `true` on the servers.

- Validate that all servers are on CE and healthy using `consul members` command

## What happens during the downgrade

During the downgrade as the raft replication logs start flowing into the ce server we handle them in one of the following ways :- 

- Drop the request

   For example :-
   - Register requests - register requests having non default namespace, having services or health checks in non default namespace or partition are dropped.

   - Peering Write Requests - peering write requests are dropped if the local partiton connecting to the peer is non default. 

- Filter out tenanted data from the request

  For example :-
  - Acl Token Batch Set requests -  acl  tokens with non default namespace or partiton are filtered out.
  - Acl Policy Batch Set requests -  acl  policies with non default namespace or partiton are filtered out.

- Panic and stop the downgrade

  For example :-
  - Service Splitter,Service Resolver,Service Router Config Entry requests - if these config entries have references to tenanted services it will cause a panic.
