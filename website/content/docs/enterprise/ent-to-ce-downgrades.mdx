  Guide to downgrade from consul enterprise to consul ce

## Introduction

This document describes some best practices that you should follow when
downgrading from Consul Enterprise to Consul CE.

## Download the CE Version

First, download the binary for the CE version you want.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Binary">

All current and past versions of the CE and Enterprise releases are
available here:

- https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Docker">

Docker containers are available at this location:

- **CE:** https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Prepare for the Downgrade to CE

**1.** Take a snapshot:

```
consul snapshot save backup.snap
```

You can inspect the snapshot to ensure if was successful with:

```
consul snapshot inspect backup.snap
```

Example output:

```
ID           2-1182-1542056499724
Size         4115
Index        1182
Term         2
Version      1
```

This will ensure you have a safe fallback option in case something goes wrong. Store
this snapshot somewhere safe. More documentation on snapshot usage is available here:

- [consul.io/commands/snapshot](/consul/commands/snapshot)
- [Backup Consul Data and State tutorial](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/backup-and-restore)

**2.** Temporarily modify your Consul configuration so that its [log_level](/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_log_level)
is set to `debug`. After doing this, issue the following command on your servers to
reload the configuration:

```
consul reload
```

This change will give you more information to work with in the event something goes wrong.


**3.** Remove references to tenanted services from service-resolver, service-splitter and service-router config entries.


## Perform the Downgrade

1. Restart or redeploy all clients with a CE version of the binary

- Update server binaries to use the CE version

- Restart or redeploy the servers one at a time with an env var named `CONSUL_ENTERPRISE_DOWNGRADE_TO_CE` set to `true` on the servers.

- Validate that all servers are on CE and healthy using `consul members` command

## What happens during the downgrade

During the downgrade as the raft replication logs start flowing into the ce server we handle them in one of the following ways:

- Drop the request

   For example :
   - Register requests - register requests having non default namespace, having services or health checks in non default namespace or partition are dropped.

   - Peering Write Requests - peering write requests are dropped if the local partiton connecting to the peer is non default. 

- Filter out tenanted data from the request

  For example :
  - Intention Sources - Intention sources targeting non default namespaces or partitions are filtered out of the config entry.
  - Exported Services - Exports of services within non default namespaces or partitions are filtered out of the config entry.

- Panic and stop the downgrade

  Config Entries regarding traffic routing cannot be safely filtered because Consul cannot know whether the resulting filtered config entries send traffic towards services which can handle that traffic. In these situations, you are required to first remove references to services within non default namespaces or partitions from within those config entries. When encountering these config entries Consul CE in the downgrade mode will panic in order to not cause harm to existing service mesh routing.
  
  For example :
  - Service Splitter,Service Resolver,Service Router Config Entry requests - if these config entries have references to tenanted services it will cause a panic.
