# Consul compared to other API Gateways 

Examples: Kong Gateway, Apigee, Mulesoft, Gravitee 

The Consul API Gateway is an implementation of the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). Traditionally, API Gateways are used for two things: _Client Traffic Management_ and _API Lifecycle Management_.

Client Traffic Management refers to controlling the point of entry for public traffic into a given environment (also known as north-south traffic). The Consul API Gateway is deployed alongside Consul service mesh and responsible for routing inbound client requests to the mesh based on defined routing routes. For a full list of supported traffic management features, please refer to the [API gateway documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/api-gateway).   

API Lifecycle management refers to how application developers use an API Gateway to deploy, iterate, and manage versions of an API. At this time, the Consul API Gateway does not support API Lifecycle management.
