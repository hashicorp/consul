  Service discovery across is one of the foundational capabilities that Consul provides. Consul is platform agnostic which allows it to dicover services across multiple runtimes and cloud providers including VMs, bare-matel, Kubernetes, EKS, AKS, ECS, Nomad, and Lambda.

# Consul Compared to Other DNS Tools

Examples: NS1, AWS Route53, AzureDNS, Cloudflare DNS

Consul was built to be a centralized service registry for dynamically tracking services that are added, changed, or removed within a compute infrastructurein any environment. Consul maintains a catalog of these registered services and keeps track of service attributes, like IP addresses or service name. Refer to our [service discovery page](https://www.consul.io/docs/intro/usecases/what-is-service-discovery) for more information.

Consul can provide basic DNS functionality including [lookups, alternate domains, and access controls](https://www.consul.io/docs/discovery/dns). Since Consul is platform agnostic, it can provide these capabilities in both cloud and on-premises data centers. Consul does not support some of the more advanced DNS capabilities such as filters or advanced routing logic. Consul can be integrated with some existing DNS solutions to support these advanced capabilities, such as [NS1](https://help.ns1.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039417093-NS1-Consul-Integration-Overview) and [DNSimple](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2022/05/consul-integration/).
