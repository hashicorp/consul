# Consul versus other configuration management tools

There are many configuration management tools available. These tools typically focus on static provisioning while Consul focuses on dynamic configuration based on service and node state. Both are equally important and work well together. Since Consul offers a number of different capabilities, there are times when it can overlap with configuration management tools.

For example, it is not uncommon to find people using Chef, Puppet, and other configuration management tools to build service discovery mechanisms. Unfortunately, configuration information is static and updates range from several minutes to hours depending on the frequency of conversion runs. Additionally, there is no mechanism to incorporate the system state in the configuration. For example, a load balancer may continue to send traffic to unhealthy nodes, further exacerbating issues. Using this approach also makes supporting multiple datacenters challenging as a central group of servers must manage all datacenters.

Consul's service discovery layer is specifically designed to dynamically track and respond to the state of the cluster. By using the integrated health checking, Consul can route traffic away from unhealthy nodes, allowing systems and services to gracefully recover. In addition, Consulâ€™s service discovery layer works with Terraform by using Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) to automate updates to network infrastructure based on dynamic changes of each service. For example, as services scale up or down, CTS triggers Terraform to update firewalls or load balancers to reflect the latest changes.  Lastly, because each datacenter runs independently, supporting multiple datacenters is no different than a single datacenter.

With that said, Consul is not a replacement for configuration management tools. These tools are still critical to set up applications, including Consul itself. Static provisioning is best managed by existing tools while dynamic state and discovery is better managed by Consul. The separation of configuration management and cluster management also has a number of advantageous side effects: Chef recipes and Puppet manifests become simpler without global state, periodic runs are no longer required for service or configuration changes, and the infrastructure can become immutable since config management runs require no global state.
