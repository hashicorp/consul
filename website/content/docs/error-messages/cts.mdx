# Consul-Terraform-Sync error messages

This topic provides information about potential error messages associated with Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS). If you receive an error message that does not appear in this section, refer to the following resources:

- [Consul error messages](/consul/docs/error-messages/consul)
- [Consul on Kubernetes error messages](/consul/docs/error-messages/k8s)
- [API Gateway error messages](/consul/docs/error-messages/api-gateway)
- [Consul Discuss forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/)

## Missing local module

If you configured the CTS cluster to run in [high availability mode](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha) and the local module is missing, then the following message appears in the log:

```log hideClipboard
[ERROR] ha.compat: error="compatibility check failure: stat ./example-module: no such file or directory"
```

The resolution is to add the missing local module on the incompatible CTS instance. Refer to the [`module` documentation](/consul/docs/reference/cts/configuration#module) in the CTS configuration reference for additional information. 

## Redirect requests to leader __ at address

```json hideClipboard
{
  "error": {
    "message": "redirect requests to leader 'cts-01' at cts-01.example.com:8558"
  }
}
```

**Conditions**:

- CTS can determine the leader.
- `high_availability.instance.address` is configured for the leader.
- The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader.

**Resolution**:

Redirect the request to the leader instance, for example:

```shell-session
$ curl --request GET cts-01.example.com:8558/v1/tasks
```


## Redirect requests to leader __

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "redirect requests to leader 'cts-01'"
  }
}
```

**Conditions**:

- CTS can determine the leader.
- The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader.
- `high_availability.instance.address` is not configured.

**Resolution**:

Identify the leader instance address and redirect the request to the leader. You can identify the leader by calling the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/reference/cts/api/status#cluster-status) or by checking the logs for the following entry:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```log
[INFO] ha: acquired leadership lock: id=<ID-OF-CTS-INSTANCE>. 
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

We recommend deploying a cluster that has three instances. 

## Redirect requests to leader

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "redirect requests to leader"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

**Conditions**:

- The CTS instance you sent the request to is not the leader. 
- The CTS is unable to determine the leader. 
- Note that these conditions are rare.

**Resolution**:

Identify and send the request to the leader CTS instance. You can identify the leader by calling the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/reference/cts/api/status#cluster-status) or by checking the logs for the following entry:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```log
[INFO] ha: acquired leadership lock: id=<ID-OF-CTS-INSTANCE>
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## This endpoint is only available with high availability configured

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "this endpoint is only available with high availability configured"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

**Conditions**:

- You called the [`status/cluster` API endpoint](/consul/docs/reference/cts/api/status#cluster-status) without configuring CTS for [high availability](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha).

**Resolution**:

Configure CTS to run in [high availability mode](/consul/docs/nia/usage/run-ha).

## Unsupported status parameter value

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "example error message: unsupported status parameter value"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

**Conditions**: 

- You sent a request to the `status` API endpoint.
- The request included an unsupported parameter value.

**Resolution**:

Send a new request and verify that all of the parameter values are correct.
