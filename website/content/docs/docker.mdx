# Consul on Docker

## Access containers

You can access a containerized Consul datacenter in several different ways.

#### Docker exec

You can execute Consul commands directly inside of your Consul containers using `docker exec`.

```shell-session
$ docker exec <container_id> consul members
Node      Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
server-1  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.14.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
client-1  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.14.3  2         dc1  default    <default>
```

#### Docker exec attach

You can also issue commands inside of your container by opening an interactive shell and using the Consul binary included in the container.

```shell-session
$ docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
# consul members
Node      Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
server-1  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.14.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
client-1  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.14.3  2         dc1  default    <default>
```

#### Local Consul binary

If you have a local Consul binary in your PATH you can also export the `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` environment variable to point to the HTTP address of a the Consul server container.

```shell-session
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=<consul_server_container_ip>:8500
```

This way you bypass invoking the Consul binary on the container and you run the Consul binary on your local machine instead. It ends up communicating with the Consul server running in the container.

```shell-session
$ consul members
Node      Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
server-1  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
client-1  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <default>
```

## Reload configuration

To do an in-memory reload, send a SIGHUP to the container.

```shell-session
$ docker kill --signal=HUP <container_id>
```

## Consul Autopilot

As long as there are enough servers in the datacenter to maintain [quorum](/consul/docs/architecture/consensus#deployment-table), Consul's [autopilot](/consul/tutorials/datacenter-operations/autopilot-datacenter-operations) feature will handle removing servers whose containers were stopped. Autopilot's default settings are configurable if you need to fine-tune them. For more information, check the [Autopilot configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/general#autopilot).

- `cleanup_dead_servers` should be set to true to make sure that a stopped container is removed from the datacenter.
- `last_contact_threshold` should be reasonably small, so that dead servers are removed quickly.
- `server_stabilization_time` should be sufficiently large (on the order of several seconds) so that unstable servers are not added to the datacenter until they stabilize.

## Backing-up data

You can back-up your Consul datacenter using the [consul snapshot](/consul/commands/snapshot) command.

```shell-session
$ docker exec <container_id> consul snapshot save backup.snap
```

This will leave the `backup.snap` snapshot file inside of your container. If you are not saving your snapshot to a [persistent volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) then you will need to use `docker cp` to move your snapshot to a location outside of your container.

```shell-session
$ docker cp <container_id>:backup.snap ./
```

To save backups automatically, refer to the Consul Enterprise feature [snapshot agent](/consul/commands/snapshot/agent). Consul Enterprise's snapshot agent also can save snapshots to Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage.

## Environment variables

The Consul Docker image supports passing configuration via multiple environment variables with the `-e` flag.

`CONSUL_CLIENT_INTERFACE` specifies the name of the interface on which Consul exposes DNS, gRPC, and HTTP APIs.
`CONSUL_CLIENT_ADDRESS` specifies the address Consul binds to for client traffic, such as DNS, gRPC, and HTTP APIs.

`CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE` specifies the interface Consul uses for internal Consul cluster communication.
`CONSUL_BIND_ADDRESS` specifies the address Consul binds to for internal Consul cluster communication.

`CONSUL_DATA_DIR` specifies the directory where Consul stores its data. This is useful for persisting data across container restarts. The default value is `/consul/data`.

`CONSUL_ALLOW_PRIVILEGED_PORTS` is a binary value and when set to `true` itruns [`setcap`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setcap.8.html) on the Consul binary, allowing it to bind to [privileged ports](https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Installation/PrivilegedPorts.html).

`CONSUL_CONFIG_DIR` allows you to specify a container directory for additional configuration files that the Consul agent will load. The default location is the `/consul/config` directory.
`CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG` allows you to pass a JSON string of configuration options to the Consul agent.

The following is an example how to define a multi-line configuration using `CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG`.

```shell-session
$ docker run -d \
  -e CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG='{
  "datacenter":"us_west",
  "server":true,
  "enable_debug":true
  }' \
  hashicorp/consul:latest \
  consul agent -server -bootstrap-expect=1 -data-dir=/consul/data
```
