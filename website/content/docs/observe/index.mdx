# Observe your service mesh

This topic provides an overview of Consul's observability features. Consul can be configured with Prometheus to provide visualizations about agent operations and service traffic between proxies in your service mesh.

Additional observability features such as service topologies and operations dashboards are available through [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/consul-central#global-cluster-views).

## Introduction

Introductory blocks are optional and may not be necessary for your overview page. If applicable, describe why the topic area is important in the introductory block. You can briefly describe the constituent topics and how they are related. 

If you use a diagram in an overview page, include it in the introduction.

Never end a section with an image. Always include at least one sentence that describes the contents of the diagram.
