# Observe service mesh on Docker containers

This page describes the configuration process for service mesh observability features when Consul runs on Docker containers.

## Introduction

Service mesh observability consists of three core elements: _metrics_, _logs_, and _traces_. To observe these elements in Consul's service mesh, use Prometheus to collect metrics, Loki to collect logs, and Tempo to collect traces. Then you can visualize this data with Grafana.

The examples on this page are not properly secured for a production environment. If you are implementing this functionality in a production system, we encourage you to review the [Consul Reference Architecture](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/reference-architecture) for Consul best practices and the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) for Docker best practices.

## Prerequisites

For Docker containers to emit Loki logs, you need to install the Loki logging drivers for Docker. Refer to the [Loki Docker driver plugin page](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/) for more information.

```shell-session
$ docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
```

## Collect metrics with Prometheus

Configure the Consul target endpoint in Prometheus. The `prometheus.yaml` file contains the configuration for Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Consul server. The `targets` field should point to the Consul server service running in your Docker environment, and the `metrics_path` should be set to Consul's agent metrics enndpoint, `/v1/agent/metrics`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="prometheus.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
  scrape_timeout: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'consul-server'
    metrics_path: '/v1/agent/metrics'
    params:
      format: ['prometheus']
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['consul-server:8500']
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Collect logs with Loki

Loki is an advanced log aggregation system developed by Grafana Labs. The `docker-compose-loki.yaml` file contains the configuration for the Loki service to run as a Docker container.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="docker-compose-loki.yaml">

```yaml
  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:2.1.0
    container_name: loki
    command: -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml
    networks:
      vpcbr:
        ipv4_address: 10.5.0.11
    ports:
      - "3100:3100" # loki needs to be exposed so it receives logs
    environment:
      - JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=tempo
      - JAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://tempo:14268/api/traces # send traces to Tempo
      - JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=const
      - JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM=1
    logging:
      driver: loki
      options:
        loki-url: 'http://localhost:3100/api/prom/push'
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This configuration allows Loki to collect logs from all containers in the Docker environment. The logs are sent to Loki using the Loki logging driver. The Loki traces are also sent to Tempo for distributed tracing.

## Collect traces with Tempo

Tempo is a distributed tracing system developed by Grafana Labs. The `docker-compose-tempo.yaml` file contains the configuration for the Tempo service to run as a Docker container.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="docker-compose-tempo.yaml">

```yaml
  tempo:
    image: grafana/tempo:1f1c40b3
    container_name: tempo
    command: ["-config.file=/etc/tempo.yaml"]
    volumes:
      - ./tempo/tempo.yaml:/etc/tempo.yaml
    networks:
      vpcbr:
        ipv4_address: 10.5.0.9
    ports:
      - "14268:14268" # jaeger ingest
      - "3100"  # tempo
      - "9411:9411" #zipkin
    logging:
      driver: loki
      options:
        loki-url: 'http://localhost:3100/api/prom/push'
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This Docker Compose configuration sets up Tempo to collect traces from the Docker environment. The traces are sent to Tempo using the Loki logging driver, which allows for seamless integration with Grafana. This Docker Compose configuration also refers to a `tempo/tempo.yaml` file that contains the Tempo configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tempo/tempo.yaml">

## Configure Grafana

You can configure Grafana can to collect and visualize metrics, logs, and traces and use Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo as data sources.

### Grafana data source: Prometheus

The `datasource-prometheus.yaml` file contains the configuration for Grafana to connect to Prometheus. The `url` field should point to the Prometheus service running in your Docker environment.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="datasource-prometheus.yaml">

```yaml
datasources:
- name: Prometheus
  type: prometheus
  access: proxy
  orgId: 1
  url: http://prometheus:9090
  basicAuth: false
  isDefault: false
  version: 1
  editable: false
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Grafana data source: Loki

The `datasource-loki.yaml` file contains the configuration for Grafana to connect to Loki. The `datasources.url` field must point to the Loki service running in your Docker environment.

### Explore the sample application

<CodeBlockConfig filename="datasource-loki.yaml">

```yaml
datasources:
- name: Loki
  type: loki
  access: proxy
  orgId: 1
  url: http://loki:3100
  basicAuth: false
  isDefault: true
  version: 1
  editable: false
  apiVersion: 1
  jsonData:
    derivedFields:
      - datasourceUid: tempo
        matcherRegex: (?:traceID|trace_id)=(\w+)
        name: TraceID
        url: $${__value.raw}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Grafana data source: Tempo

The `datasource-tempo.yaml` file contains the configuration for Grafana to connect to Tempo. The `url` field should point to the Tempo service running in your Docker environment.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="datasource-tempo.yaml">

```yaml
datasources:
- name: Tempo
  type: tempo
  access: proxy
  orgId: 1
  url: http://tempo:3100
  basicAuth: false
  isDefault: false
  version: 1
  editable: false
  apiVersion: 1
  uid: tempo
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Grafana dashboards

In order to visualize the data collected by Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo, you can import pre-built dashboards into Grafana. The configuration is applied to Grafana in the following way, and refers to a directory called `dashboards`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="grafana-dashboards.yaml">

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
- name: 'dashboards'
  orgId: 1
  folder: 'dashboards'
  folderUid: ''
  type: file
  disableDeletion: true
  editable: true
  updateIntervalSeconds: 3600
  allowUiUpdates: false
  options:
    path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

For the contents of the `dashboards` directory, refer to [Dashboards for service mesh observability](/consul/docs/observe/grafana), which documents the dashboard configurations in [the `hashicorp/consul` GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/tree/main/grafana).

You can also refer to the Docker-specific content in the [Grafana Dashboards repository](https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-consul-docker/tree/main/datacenter-deploy-observability/grafana/dashboards).

## Use Grafana to explore your service mesh

Now that you have configured the Grafana data sources, you can visualize the data collected.

### Explore traces in Grafana

You can explore the traces collected by Tempo in Grafana. Navigate to Grafana's **Explore** section and execute a search for traces. For example, to view traces from a container named `web`, execute a Grafana search for `{container_name="web"} |= "trace_id"`. Then open one of the log lines, locate the `TraceID` field, then click the nearby `Tempo` link to jump directly from logs to traces. 

![Image of linked logs and traces in Grafana UI.](/img/docker/observability_grafana_logs_traces.png 'There are two panes within the window: a left and right pane. In the left pane, the Loki logs are shown, with one of its entries selected. On the right pane, a Tempo traces graph is shown. The Tempo traces graph shows communication details between the three services, ingress, web, and api.')

Traces provide insight into service mesh performance. To learn more about how application communication traverses through the service mesh, refer to [our blog on distributed tracing](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/enabling-distributed-tracing-with-hashicorp-consul), as well as the [distributed tracing documentation](/consul/docs/observe/distributed-tracing).

### Explore metrics in Grafana

You can explore the metrics collected by Prometheus in Grafana. Navigate to the **Dashboards** section and select the **Consul Server Monitoring** dashboard. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the Consul server metrics, including Raft commit time, catalog operation time, and autopilot health.

![Image of Consul Server Monitoring metrics dashboard in Grafana UI.](/img/docker/observability_grafana_consul_metrics.png 'A dashboard is shown with four panes present. Each of the panes shows details around various metrics generated by Consul including Raft commit time, catalog operation time, and autopilot health.')

This dashboard presents important application-level metrics for Consul and provides important insight into the health and performance of your service mesh. To learn more about the various runtime metrics reported by Consul, refer to the [Consul telemetry docs](/consul/docs/reference/agent/telemetry).
