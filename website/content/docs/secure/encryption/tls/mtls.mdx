# Manage agent mTLS encryption

This topic describes mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption between agents in a Consul datacenter.

This mTLS encryption is distinct from Consul service mesh mTLS encryption. To learn about encrypted mTLS communication between services, refer to [service mesh certificate authority](/consul/docs/secure-mesh/certificate).

## Benefits of TLS encryption

Consul supports TLS certificates that verify the authenticity of servers and clients to secure `RCP`, `gRPC`, and `HTTP` traffic.

Implementing TLS encryption in Consul datacenters improves your deployment's security in the following ways:

- **Encrypt data in transit:** TLS encrypts data transmitted between Consul datacenter nodes and user interfaces such as the UI or CLI to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized parties.

- **Agent authentication:** TLS ensures that only verified parties can communicate with each other using certificates. This security measure prevents unauthorized nodes, services, and users from interacting with your Consul datacenter.

- **Prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Without TLS, attackers may intercept and change communications within your Consul deployments. TLS mitigates this risk by encrypting data and verifying the identity of the communication participants.

- **Comply with security regulations and standards:** Compliance frameworks and regulations like PCI-DSS and HIPAA mandate the encryption of data in transit, which makes TLS a requirement for Consul deployments in regulated environments.

Mutual TLS (mTLS) requires that all clients and servers have key pairs that are generated by a single Certification Authority (CA). We recommend using a private CA that is not shared with other applications.

The following parameters in agent configuration files define the agent verification behavior:

- [`tls.defaults.verify_incoming`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/tls#tls_defaults_verify_incoming)
- [`tls.defaults.verify_outgoing`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/tls#tls_defaults_verify_outgoing)
- [`tls.defaults.verify_server_hostname`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/tls#tls_default_verify_server_hostname)

## Workflow

The process to enable TLS encryption in Consul deployments consists of the following steps:

1. [Initialize the built-in CA](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#initialize-the-built-in-ca) used to sign all certificates.
1. [Create server certificates](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#create-server-certificates) to secure Consul servers.
1. [Configure server agents](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#configure-server-agents) for TLS encryption.
1. [Start server agents](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#start-consul-servers).
1. [Configure Consul client agents](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#configure-client-agents).
1. [Start client agents](/consul/docs/security/encryption/mtls#start-consul-clients).

## Initialize the built-in CA

The first step to configure mTLS for Consul is to initialize the certificate authority (CA) that signs the certificates. To prevent unauthorized datacenter access, Consul requires that all certificates are signed by the same CA. We recommend using a private CA because any certificate it signs will be allowed to communicate with the Consul datacenter.

Consul supports a variety of tools for creating and managing your own CA, like the [PKI secrets engine in Vault](/vault/docs/secrets/pki) or the [Terraform TLS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs). Consul also ships with built-in TLS tools to create and manage certificates.

If you have the Consul binary installed on your path, you can create the CA and certificates, even before you start a Consul server agent.

```shell-session
$ consul tls ca create -domain=consul
==> Saved consul-agent-ca.pem
==> Saved consul-agent-ca-key.pem
```

The command generates two files, `<domain>-agent-ca.pem` and `<domain>-agent-ca-key.pem`. In this example, the domain used to generate the certificates is the default one, `consul`.

The CA certificate, `consul-agent-ca.pem`, contains the public key necessary to validate Consul certificates. You must distribute this certificate to every node where a Consul agent runs.

The CA key, `consul-agent-ca-key.pem`, signs certificates for Consul nodes. You must keep this key private. Possession of this key allows anyone to run Consul as a trusted server or generate new valid certificates for the datacenter. Malicious actors may use this key to obtain access to all Consul data, including ACL tokens.

## Create server certificates

To authenticate Consul servers, servers are provided with a special certificate that lists `server.<domain>.<datacenter>` in the `Common Name` and `Subject Alternative Name` fields. When you enable [`tls.defaults.verify_server_hostname`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/tls#tls_default_verify_server_hostname), only agents that provide this certificate are allowed to boot as a server.

Without `tls.defaults.verify_server_hostname = true`, an attacker who compromises a Consul client agent can restart the agent as a server to get access to all the data in your datacenter. You must keep the server key private to protect your Consul data.

The following example creates a server certificate for datacenter `dc1` in the `consul` domain. If your datacenter or domain is different, modify the command to use the appropriate flag values.

```shell-session
$ consul tls cert create -server -dc=dc1 -domain=consul
==> WARNING: Server Certificates grants authority to become a
    server and access all state in the cluster including root keys
    and all ACL tokens. Do not distribute them to production hosts
    that are not server nodes. Store them as securely as CA keys.
==> Using consul-agent-ca.pem and consul-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Saved dc1-server-consul-0.pem
==> Saved dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem
```

Repeat this process on the same node where you created the CA until the number of certificates is equal to the number of servers in the datacenter. You can run the command multiple times in a row, and it automatically increases the certificate and key numbers each time.

### Federated Consul datacenter

A federated Consul environment requires the server certificate to include the names of all Consul datacenters that are within the federated environment.

Use the `-additional-dnsname` flag to provide an additional DNS names for Subject Alternative Names. `localhost` is always included. You can provide this flag multiple times in a single command.

The following example creates a certificate for a federated environment containing two Consul datacenters named `dc1` and `dc2`.

```shell-session
$ consul tls cert create -server -dc dc1 -domain=consul -additional-dnsname="server.dc2.consul"
==> WARNING: Server Certificates grants authority to become a
    server and access all state in the cluster including root keys
    and all ACL tokens. Do not distribute them to production hosts
    that are not server nodes. Store them as securely as CA keys.
==> Using consul-agent-ca.pem and consul-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Saved dc1-server-consul-0.pem
==> Saved dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem
```

## Configure server agents

After you generate the server certificates, distribute them to the Consul servers and modify the agent configuration file to include their local location.

Copy the following files to each Consul server:

- `consul-agent-ca.pem`: CA public certificate.
- `dc1-server-consul-0.pem`: Consul server node public certificate for first server node in the `dc1` datacenter in the `consul` domain.
- `dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem`: Consul server node private key for first server node in the `dc1` datacenter in the `consul` domain.

There are two methods for configuring Consul server agents depending on the way you want to distribute certificates to the client agents:

- The _auto encryption method_ uses the Consul Connect CA to generate client certificates and then automatically distributes them to all Consul clients.
- The _operator method_ requires you to manually generate client certificates and distribute them to each client agent individually.

We recommend using the auto-encryption method with the built-in CA because Consul can then automatically rotate certificates without requiring operator intervention.

Use the operator method if you need to use a third-party CA or need more fine-grained control over certificate management.

Consul does not enable TLS for HTTP unless the `https` port is assigned a port number greater than `0`. We recommend using `8501`, the default number for the `https` port, because this default is designed to work automatically with other tools.

## Start Consul servers

After you configure your servers, start the Consul process.

```shell-session
$ systemctl start consul
```

Your Consul servers can now communicate with TLS encryption for RPC and consensus.

## Configure client agents

Next, configure your client agents with the same method you used to [configure the server agent](#distribute-the-server-certificates)

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Auto-encryption method" group="auto">

The only file you need on the local disk to configure the Consul client agents using auto-encryption is the CA certificate `consul-agent-ca-.pem`.

On the node where you created the CA and server certificates, generate a client certificate with `consul tls cert create -client` command.

```shell-session
$ consul tls cert create -client -dc=dc1 -domain=consul
==> Using consul-agent-ca.pem and consul-agent-ca-key.pem
==> Saved dc1-client-consul-0.pem
==> Saved dc1-client-consul-0-key.pem
```

The client certificate is also signed by the same CA used for the server certificates, but it does not contain `server.<domain>.<datacenter>` in the `Common Name` and in the `Subject Alternative Name`. Because `verify_server_hostname` is enabled, a compromised client cannot use this certificate to start as a server and access datacenter data.

Distribute the client certificates and the CA certificate `consul-agent-ca.pem` to every Consul client in the datacenter. Then add them to the client agent configuration.

## Start Consul clients

After you configure each client, start the Consul process on the node.

```shell-session
$ systemctl start consul
```

Your client agents now communicate using mutual TLS encryption.

## API, CLI, and UI interactions

The configuration snippets provided in this page are valid to configure complete mTLS for your Consul datacenter. This means that all interfaces require the client to provide a valid certificate in order to communicate with the Consul agent. This is valid for all requests, API, CLI, and UI.

Since Consul v1.12 it is possible to have different settings for:

 - the HTTP protocol, used for the Consul's REST API, the CLI integration, and the UI
 - the RPC protocol, used for internal communications between the Consul agents.

### Interact with Consul without a client certificate

If you want to avoid the need to present a valid client certificate every time you interact with Consul using the HTTP API, CLI, or UI, configure Consul to trust all incoming HTTPS connections by setting `tls.https.verify_incoming` to `false`. RPC communications are still mTLS encrypted.

<CodeTabs>

```hcl
addresses = {
  https = "0.0.0.0"
}
ports {
  https = 8501
  http  = -1
}
tls {
  https {
    ca_file   = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent-ca.pem"
    cert_file = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent.pem"
    key_file  = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent-key.pem"
    verify_incoming = false
    verify_outgoing = true

      "verify_server_hostname": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Use HTTP for local client interaction

If you want to avoid the need to present a valid client certificate or to use the CA certificate every time you interact with the local Consul agent, configure Consul to keep the HTTP listener active on the `localhost` interface only and set `tls.https.verify_incoming` to `false`. External requests to the API or UI are still protected by TLS encryption, but requests that originate locally do not need to present a client certificate. RPC communications are still mTLS encrypted.

addresses = {
  https = "0.0.0.0"
  http  = "127.0.0.1"
}
ports {
  https = 8501

}
tls {
  https {
    ca_file   = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent-ca.pem"
    cert_file = "/etc/consul.d/consul-agent.pem"

## Compare supported Certificate Authorities (CAs)

Consul supports several Certificate Authorities (CAs) for encrypting agent communication.

The following table lists the certificates you must generate with each CA to secure Consul operations:

| Certificate authority | Server certificate | Client certificate | Envoy certificate |
| ---------------------- | :----------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
| Consul embedded CA     | &#9989;                 | &#9989;  (manual)        | &#10060;                |
| Consul service mesh CA | &#10060;                 | &#9989;  (`auto_config` or `auto_encrypt`) | &#9989; |
| 3rd party CA           | &#9989;                 | &#9989;  (manual)        | &#10060;                |
| Vault                  | &#9989;                 | &#9989;  (`auto_config` or `auto_encrypt`) | &#9989; |

The table below offers an overview of the different options with default values and storage locations for the different CAs. 

| Feature                                    | Consul agent CA  | Consul service mesh CA | 3rd party CA     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Certificate generation                     | Manual           | Automatic              | Varies           |
| Certificate rotation                       | Manual           | Automatic              | Varies           |
| Certificate storage location               | Raft state store | Agent memory           | Raft state store |
| Default expiration for CA certificates     | 5 years          | 10 years               | Varies           |
| Default expiration for agent certificates  | 1 year           | 3 days                 | Varies           |

## Next steps

Your agents are now configured with mTLS for encrypted communication. With the auto encryption method, your
client certificates are managed by the server. With the operator method, you distributed all the certificates manually, but have a more flexible configuration.

Documentation for the commands used in this topic is available at [TLS configuration parameters for Consul agent configuration files](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/tls) and the [`consul tls` CLI command reference](/consul/commands/tls).

To learn how to automate TLS certificate generation and rotation, refer to the [Generate mTLS Certificates for Consul with Vault](/consul/docs/automate/consul-template/vault/mtls) tutorial.

To continue securing your Consul deployment, add [gossip encryption](/consul/docs/secure/encryption/gossip/enable) and enable [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](/consul/docs/secure/acl) with the default deny policy.
