# Use Consul API Gateway

This topic describes how to use Consul API Gateway.

## Basic usage

Complete the following steps to use Consul API Gateway in your network.

1. Verify that the [requirements](/docs/api-gateway/tech-specs) have been met.
1. Verify that the Consul API Gateway CRDs and controller have been installed and applied. Refer to [Installation](/docs/api-gateway/install) for details.
1. Configure your [`Gateway`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/gateway) and [`Routes`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes) as describe in the [Configuration](/docs/api-gateway/configuration) section.

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard filename="values.yaml">

    ```yaml
      apiGateway:
        enabled: true
        managedGatewayClass:
    ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Issue the `kubectl apply` command to implement the configurations:

  ```shell-session
    $ kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml routes.yaml
  ```

## Reroute HTTP requests

Configure the following fields in your `Route` configuration to use this feature. Refer to the [Route configuration reference](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes) for details about the parameters.

* [`rules.filters.type`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-type): Set this parameter to `URLRewrite` to instruct Consul API Gateway to rewrite the URL when specific conditions are met. 
* [`rules.filters.urlRewrite`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite): Specify the `path` configuration.
* [`rules.filters.urlRewrite.path`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite-path): Contains the paths that incoming requests should be rewritten to based on the match conditions.  

Note that if the route is configured to accept paths with and without a trailing slash, you must make two separate routes to handle each case.

### Example

In the following example, requests to` /incoming-request-prefix/` are forwarded to the `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/`. A request to `/incoming-request-prefix/request-path`, for instance, is received by the `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/request-path`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="route.yaml">

```yaml hideClipboard
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
 name: example-route
 ##...
spec:
 parentRefs:
   - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
     kind: Gateway
     name: api-gateway
 rules:
   - backendRefs:
     . . .
     filters:
       - type: URLRewrite
         urlRewrite:
           path:
             replacePrefixMatch: /prefix-backend-receives/
             type: ReplacePrefixMatch
     matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /incoming–request-prefix/
```
</CodeBlockConfig>

### Using the Consul API Gateway Binary

You can download the Consul API Gateway binary and use it to manually start the control plane server.

1. Download the binary from the [Consul API Gateway repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway).
1. Navigate to the `consul-api-gateway-main` directory and build the binary:

```shell-session
$ go build
```

1.  (Optional) Copy the binary to the execution path, e.g.:

```shell-session
$ cp consul-api-gateway /usr/bin
```

1.  Use the `server` command to interact with the Consul API Gateway binary:

```shell-session
$ ./consul-api-gateway server <options>
```

The following options are supported:

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Required | Default                                                                 |

### Helm installation failed: "no matches for kind"

```log
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: [unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "GatewayClass" in version "gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2", unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "GatewayClassConfig" in version "api-gateway.consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1"]
```
**Conditions:**
Consul API Gateway generates this error when the required CRD files have not been installed in Kubernetes prior to installing Consul API Gateway.

**Impact:**
The installation process typically fails after this error message is generated.

**Recommended Action:**
Install the required CRDs by using the command in Step 1 of the [Consul API Gateway installation instructions](/docs/api-gateway/install#installation) and then retry installing Consul API Gateway.
