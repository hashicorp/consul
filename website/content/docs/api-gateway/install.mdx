# Install Consul API Gateway

This topic describes how to install and configure Consul API Gateway.

## Requirements

Ensure that the environment you are deploying Consul API Gateway in meets the requirements listed in the [Technical Specifications][tech-specs]. This includes validating that the requirements for minimum versions of software are met. Refer to the [Release Notes][rel-notes] for the version of API Gateway you are deploying.

## Installation

1. Set the version of Consul API Gateway you are installing as an environment variable. The following steps use this environment variable in commands and configurations.

  ```shell-session
  $ export VERSION=0.3.0
  ```

1. Issue the following command to install the CRDs:

  ```shell-session
  $ kubectl apply --kustomize="github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/config/crd?ref=v$VERSION"
  ```

1. Create a `values.yaml` file for your Consul API Gateway deployment by copying the following content and running it in the environment where you set the `VERSION` environment variable. The Consul Helm chart uses this `values.yaml` file to deploy the API Gateway. Available versions of the [Consul](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul/tags) and [Consul API Gateway](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/tags) Docker images can be found on DockerHub, with additional context on version compatibility published in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-gateway/releases). For more options to configure your Consul API Gateway deployment through the Helm chart, refer to [Helm Chart Configuration - apiGateway](https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/helm#apigateway).

    <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

      ```shell
        cat <<EOF > values.yaml
          global:
            name: consul
          connectInject:
            enabled: true
          apiGateway:
            enabled: true
            image: hashicorp/consul-api-gateway:$VERSION
        EOF
      ```
    </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Install Consul API Gateway using the standard Consul Helm chart or Consul K8s CLI specify the custom values file. Available versions of the [Consul Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/releases) can be found in GitHub releases.

    ```shell-session
    $ brew tap hashicorp/tap
    ```

    ```shell-session
    $ brew install hashicorp/tap/consul-k8s
    ```

    ```shell-session
    $ consul-k8s install -config-file=values.yaml -set global.image=hashicorp/consul:1.12.2
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Helm">

    Add the HashiCorp Helm repository.

    ```shell-session
    $ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
    ```
    Install Consul with API Gateway on your Kubernetes cluster by specifying the `values.yaml` file.

    ```shell-session
    $ helm install consul hashicorp/consul --version 0.45.0 --values values.yaml --create-namespace --namespace consul
    ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
