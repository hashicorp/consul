# API gateway for Kubernetes technical specifications

This topic describes the technical specifications associated with using Consul API gateway.

## Requirements

Verify that your environment meets the following requirements prior to using Consul API gateway.

### Datacenter requirements

Your datacenter must meet the following requirements prior to configuring the Consul API gateway:

- HashiCorp Consul Helm chart v1.2.0 and later

### TCP port requirements

The following table describes the TCP port requirements for each component of the API gateway.

| Port | Description | Component |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| 20000 | Kubernetes readiness probe | Gateway instance pod |
| Configurable | Port for scraping Prometheus metrics. Disabled by default. | Gateway controller pod |

## Consul server deployments

- Consul Editions supported: OSS and Enterprise
- Supported Consul Server deployment types:
  - Self-Managed
  - HCP Consul

### Limited Support of some Consul Features

The following table lists API gateway limitations related to specific Consul features

| Consul Feature | Limitation |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Routing between datacenters | If you are connecting multiple Consul datacenters to create a federated network, you can route to services in other datacenters through peered connections. Refer to [Route Traffic to Peered Services](/consul/docs/api-gateway/usage/route-to-peered-services) for additional information. |

## Deployment Environments

Consul API gateway can be deployed in the following Kubernetes-based environments:

- Generic Kubernetes
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Supported versions of Kubernetes Gateway API specification 

Refer to the [release notes](/consul/docs/release-notes) for your version of Consul.

## Resource allocations

The following resources are allocated for each component of the API gateway.

### Gateway controller pod

- **CPU**: None. Either the namespace or cluster default is allocated, depending on the Kubernetes cluster configuration.
- **Memory**: None. Either the the namespace or cluster default is allocated, depending on the Kubernetes cluster configuration.

### Gateway instance pod

- **CPU**: None. Either the namespace or cluster default is allocated, depending on the Kubernetes cluster configuration.
- **Memory**: None. Either the namespace or cluster default is allocated, depending on the Kubernetes cluster configuration.
