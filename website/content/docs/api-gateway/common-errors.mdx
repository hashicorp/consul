Some of the errors messages commonly encountered during installation and operations of Consul API Gateway, are listed below, along with suggested methods for resolving them.

If the error message is not listed on this page, it may be listed on the main [Consul Common errors][consul-common-errors] page. If the error message is not listed on this page or that one, please consider following our general [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

    ***************************************************************************
    Each common error should have its own section on this page. Each section
    should start with a heading line that is a short description of the error or
    the the text of the error.

    Two examples:
        ### Failed opening file during installation
        ### Message: "Can't connect to repository" when running Helm chart

    ***************************************************************************
