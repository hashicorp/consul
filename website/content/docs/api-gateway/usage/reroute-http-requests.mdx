# Reroute HTTP Requests

This topic describes how to configure Consul API Gateway to reroute HTTP requests. 

## Requirements

1. Verify that the [requirements](/docs/api-gateway/tech-specs) have been met.
1. Verify that the Consul API Gateway CRDs and controller have been installed and applied. Refer to [Installation](/docs/api-gateway/install) for details.

## Configuration

Specify the following fields in your `Route` configuration. Refer to the [Route configuration reference](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes) for details about the parameters.

- [`rules.filters.type`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-type): Set this parameter to `URLRewrite` to instruct Consul API Gateway to rewrite the URL when specific conditions are met. 
- [`rules.filters.urlRewrite`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite): Specify the `path` configuration.
- [`rules.filters.urlRewrite.path`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite-path): Contains the paths that incoming requests should be rewritten to based on the match conditions.  

To configure the route to accept paths with or without a trailing slash, you must make two separate routes to handle each case.

### Example

In the following example, requests to` /incoming-request-prefix/` are forwarded to the `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/`. As a result, requests to `/incoming-request-prefix/request-path` are received by `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/request-path`.
