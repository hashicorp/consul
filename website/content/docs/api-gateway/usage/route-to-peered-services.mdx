# Route Traffic to Peered Services

This topic describes how to configure Consul API Gateway to route traffic to services connected to the mesh through a peering connection.

## Requirements

1. Verify that the [requirements](/docs/api-gateway/tech-specs) have been met.
1. Verify that the Consul API Gateway CRDs and controller have been installed and applied. Refer to [Installation](/docs/api-gateway/install) for details.
1. Verify that a peering connection has been established between Consul clusters and that at least one service has been exported to the cluster containing your `Gateway`. Refer to [Cluster Peering on Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/k8s) for details.

## Configuration

Configure the following fields in your `MeshService` configuration to use this feature. Refer to the [MeshService configuration reference](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/mesh) for details about the parameters.

* [`name`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/meshservice#name)
* [`peer`](/docs/api-gateway/configuration/meshservice#peer)

## Example

In the following example, routes using the example-mesh-service as a backend will send requests to the `echo` service exported by the peered Consul cluster, `dc2`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="meshservice.yaml">

```yaml hideClipboard
apiVersion: api-gateway.consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: MeshService
metadata:
  name: example-mesh-service
  ##...
spec:
  name: echo
  peer: dc2
```
</CodeBlockConfig>
