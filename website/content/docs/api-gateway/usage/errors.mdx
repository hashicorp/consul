## Helm installation failed: "no matches for kind"

```log
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: [unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "GatewayClass" in version "gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2", unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "GatewayClassConfig" in version "api-gateway.consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1"]
```
**Conditions:**
Consul API Gateway generates this error when the required CRD files have not been installed in Kubernetes prior to installing Consul API Gateway.

**Impact:**
The installation process typically fails after this error message is generated.

**Resolution:**
Install the required CRDs. Refer to the [Consul API Gateway installation instructions](/consul/docs/api-gateway/install#installation) for instructions.

### Operation cannot be fulfilled, the object has been modified

```
{"error": "Operation cannot be fulfilled on gatewayclassconfigs.consul.hashicorp.com \"consul-api-gateway\": the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again"}

```
**Conditions:**
This error occurs when the gateway controller attempts to reconcile an object that has been modified previously. It is a normal part of running the controller and will resolve itself the next time the reconciliation loop is run.

**Impact:**
Excessive error logs are produced, but there is no impact to the functionality of the controller.

**Resolution:**
No action needs to be taken to resolve this issue,
