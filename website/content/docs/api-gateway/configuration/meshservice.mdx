# MeshService

This topic provides full details about the `MeshService` resource.

## Introduction

A `MeshService` is a resource in the Kubernetes cluster that enables Kubernetes configuration models, such as `HTTPRoute` and `TCPRoute`, to reference services that only exist in Consul. A `MeshService` represents a service in the Consul service mesh outside the Kubernetes cluster where Consul API Gateway is deployed. The service represented by the `MeshService` resource must be in the same Consul datacenter as the Kubernetes cluster.
