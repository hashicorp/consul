# MeshService Resource Configuration

This topic provides full details about the `MeshService` resource.

## Introduction

A `MeshService` is a resource in the Kubernetes cluster that enables Kubernetes configuration models, such as `HTTPRoute` and `TCPRoute`, to reference services that only exist in Consul.
A `MeshService` represents a service in the Consul service mesh outside the Kubernetes cluster where Consul API Gateway is deployed.
The service represented by the `MeshService` resource must either be in the same Consul datacenter as the Kubernetes cluster or imported from a peered Consul cluster.


## Configuration Model

The following outline shows how to format the configurations in the `MeshService` object. Click on a property name to view details about the configuration.

* [`name`](#name): string | required
* [`peer`](#peer): string | optional


## Specification

This topic provides details about the configuration parameters.

### name
Specifies the name of the service in the Consul service mesh to send traffic to.
* Type: string
* Required: required

### peer
Specifies the name of the peered Consul cluster from where the service is exported. If not specified, Consul defaults to the local datacenter.

You must apply a [`ServiceResolver`](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-resolver) for the referenced service. The `ServiceResolver` configuration entry enables Consul to resolve routes to upstream service instances. 

* Type: string
* Required: optional
