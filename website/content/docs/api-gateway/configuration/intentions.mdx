# Route resource configuration

This topic describes how to create and configure `Intention` resources for Consul API Gateway. Intentions are mechanisms that control traffic communication between services in the Consul service mesh.

## Create an intention

The following example creates an intention for the `echo` service that allows traffic from the `api-gateway` service:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="intentions.yaml">

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceIntentions
  metadata:
  name: api-gateway
  spec:
  destination:
    name: echo
  sources:
    - name: api-gateway
      action: allow
  ```

</CodeBlockConfig>
