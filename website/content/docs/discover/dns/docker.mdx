# Discover services running on Docker containers

This topic provides an overview for deploying a Consul server when running Consul on Docker containers.

## Use Consul DNS to discover the counting service

Now you can query Consul for the location of your service using the following dig command against Consul's DNS.

```shell-session
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 counting.service.consul
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 counting.service.consul

You can also access your newly registered service from Consul's UI, [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500).
