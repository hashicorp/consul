# Discover services with Consul on Kubernetes

This topic provides an overview of Consul service discovery operations when running on Kubernetes.

You can use KubeDNS to perform service discovery operations by default. If you use Consul's service mesh features and prefer to use KubeDNS, refer to [onboard services in transparent proxy mode](/consul/docs/connect/proxy/transparent-proxy).

## Introduction

Kubernetes deployments support Consul's service discovery features. When running Consul on Kubernetes, you can adopt either of the following service discovery strategies:

- [Configure Kubernetes to use Consul DNS](/consul/docs/discover/dns/k8s)
- Use KubeDNS to resolve DNS addresses and manage service discovery in your employment

You can also use the `kubectl exec` command to connect directly to a Consul container and interact with Consul's service discovery features.

If you use KubeDNS with Consul's service mesh enabled, you must also configure [transparent proxy mode](/consul/docs/connect/proxy/transparent-proxy) to enable permissive mTLS between services.
