## Common errors on Kubernetes

The following error messages are specific to Kubernetes issues.

### Unable to connect to the Consul client on the same host

If the pods are unable to connect to a Consul client running on the same host,
first check if the Consul clients are up and running with `kubectl get pods`.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get pods --selector="component=client"
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
consul-kzws6   1/1     Running   0          58s
```

If you are still unable to connect
and see `i/o timeout` or `connection refused` errors when connecting to the Consul client on the Kubernetes worker,
this could be because the CNI (Container Networking Interface)
does not [support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#support-hostport)
the use of `hostPort`.

```text
Put http://10.0.0.10:8500/v1/catalog/register: dial tcp 10.0.0.10:8500: connect: connection refused
```

```text
Put http://10.0.0.10:8500/v1/agent/service/register: dial tcp 10.0.0.10:8500: connect: connection refused
```

```text
Get http://10.0.0.10:8500/v1/status/leader: dial tcp 10.0.0.10:8500: i/o timeout
```

The IP `10.0.0.10` above refers to the IP of the host where the Consul client pods are running.

To work around this issue,
enable [`hostNetwork`](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-client-hostnetwork) in your Helm values.
Using the host network will enable the pod to use the host's network namespace without
the need for CNI to support port mappings between containers and the host.

```yaml
client:
  hostNetwork: true
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
```

-> **Note:** Using host network has security implications
as doing so gives the Consul client unnecessary access to all network traffic on the host.
We recommend raising an issue with the CNI you're using to add support for `hostPort`
and switching back to `hostPort` eventually.

### consul-server-connection-manager: ACL auth method login failed: error="rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = Permission denied"

If you see this error in the init container logs of service mesh pods, check that the pod has a service account name that matches its Service.
For example, this deployment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  # This name will be the service name in Consul.
  name: static-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: static-server
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: static-server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: static-server
  template:
    metadata:
      name: static-server
      labels:
        app: static-server
      annotations:
        'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: static-server
          image: hashicorp/http-echo:latest
          args:
            - -text="hello world"
            - -listen=:8080
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
      serviceAccountName: does-not-match
```

Will fail because the `serviceAccountName` is `does-not-match` instead of `static-server`.
