# Consul Dataplane CLI Reference

The `consul-dataplane` command interacts with the binary for [simplified service mesh with Consul Dataplane](/consul/docs/connect/dataplane). Use this command to install Consul Dataplane, configure its Envoy proxies, and secure Dataplane deployments.

## Usage

Usage: `consul-dataplane [options]`

### Requirements

Consul Dataplane requires servers running Consul version `v1.14+`. To find a specific version of Consul, refer to [Hashicorp's Official Release Channels](https://www.hashicorp.com/official-release-channels).

## Examples

### DNS

Consul Dataplane resolves a domain name to discover Consul server IP addresses.

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-dataplane -addresses my.consul.example.com
  ```

### Executable Command

Consul Dataplane runs a script that, on success, returns one or more IP addresses separated by whitespace.

  ```shell-session
  $ ./my-script.sh
  172.20.0.1
  172.20.0.2
  172.20.0.3

  $ consul-dataplane -addresses "exec=./my-script.sh"
  ```

### Go Discover Nodes for Cloud Providers

The [`go-discover`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover) binary is included in the `hashicorp/consul-dataplane` image for use with this mode of server discovery, which functions in
  a way similar to [Cloud Auto-join](/consul/docs/install/cloud-auto-join). The
  following example demonstrates how to use the `go-discover` binary with Consul Dataplane.

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-dataplane -addresses "exec=discover -q addrs provider=aws region=us-west-2 tag_key=consul-server tag_value=true"
  ```

### Static token

A static ACL token is passed to Consul Dataplane.

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-dataplane -credential-type "static"` -static-token "12345678-90ab-cdef-0000-12345678abcd"
  ```

### Auth method login

Consul Dataplane logs in to one of Consul's supported [auth methods](/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods).

  <Tabs>
  <Tab heading="Consul OSS">

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-dataplane -credential-type "login"
    -login-auth-method <method> \
    -login-bearer-token <token> \  ## Or -login-bearer-token-path
    -login-datacenter <datacenter> \
    -login-meta key1=val1 -login-meta key2=val2 \
  ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab heading="Consul Enterprise">

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-dataplane -credential-type "login"
    -login-auth-method <method> \
    -login-bearer-token <token> \  ## Or -login-bearer-token-path
    -login-datacenter <datacenter> \
    -login-meta key1=val1 -login-meta key2=val2 \
    -login-namespace <namespace> \
    -login-partition <partition>
  ```

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

### Consul Servers Behind a Load Balancer

When Consul servers are behind a load balancer, you must pass `-server-watch-disabled` to Consul
Dataplane.

```shell-session
$ consul-dataplane -server-watch-disabled
```

By default, Consul Dataplane opens a server watch stream to a Consul server, which enables the server
to inform Consul Dataplane of new or different Consul server addresses. However, if Consul Dataplane
is connecting through a load balancer, then it must ignore the Consul server addresses that are
returned from the server watch stream.
