# Consul and Nomad Integration

Consul service mesh can be used with [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) to provide
secure service-to-service communication between Nomad jobs and task groups.
Nomad is a simple, flexible scheduler and workload orchestrator. The ability to
use the [dynamic port](/nomad/docs/job-specification/network#dynamic-ports)
feature of Nomad with Consul service mesh reduces operational complexity.
