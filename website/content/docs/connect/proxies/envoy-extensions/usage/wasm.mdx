# Run WebAssembly plug-ins in Envoy proxy     

This topic describes how to use the `wasm` extension, which directs Consul to run your WebAssembly (Wasm) plug-ins for Envoy proxies. 

## Workflow

You can create Wasm plugins for Envoy and integrate them using the `wasm` extension. Wasm is a binary instruction format for stack-based virtual machines that has the potential to run anywhere after it has been compiled. Wasm plug-ins run as filters in a service mesh application's sidecar proxy.

The following steps describe the process of integrating Wasm plugins:

- Create your Wasm plugin. You must ensure that your plugin functions as expected. Refer to the [WebAssembly website](https://webassembly.org/) for information and links to documentation.
- Configure an `EnvoyExtensions` block in a service defaults or proxy defaults configuration entry. 
- Apply the configuration entry.

## Add the `EnvoyExtensions`

Add Envoy extension configuration to a proxy defaults or service defaults configuration entry. Place the extension configuration in an `EnvoyExtensions` block in the configuration entry.

- When you configure Envoy extensions on proxy defaults, they apply to every service.
- When you configure Envoy extensions on service defaults, they apply to a specific service.

Consul applies Envoy extensions configured in proxy defaults before it applies extensions in service defaults. As a result, the Envoy extension configuration in service defaults may override configurations in proxy defaults.

In the following example, the extension uses an upstream service named `file-server` to serve a Wasm-based web application firewall (WAF).

Refer to the [Wasm extension configuration reference](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy-extensions/configuration/wasm) for details on how to configure the extension. 

Refer to the [proxy defaults configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/proxy-defaults) and [service defaults configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-defaults) for details on how to define the configuration entries. 

!> **Warning:** Adding Envoy extensions default proxy configurations may have unintended consequences. We recommend configuring `EnvoyExtensions` in service defaults configuration entries in most cases.

## Apply the configuration entry

If your network is deployed to virtual machines, use the `consul config write` command and specify the proxy defaults or service defaults configuration entry to apply the configuration. For Kubernetes-orchestrated networks, use the `kubectl apply` command. The following example applies the extension in a proxy defaults configuration entry.
