# API Gateway Overview

API Gateway provides a highly configurable ingress for requests into a Consul
network. Configuration of this ingress is done across multiple related
configuration entries. The API gateway itself provides an endpoint for requests
to enter the network. The Gateway can be configured with listeners that expose
ports on the endpoint for ingress. HTTP and TCP route configuration entries can
be attached to these listeners to control how requests are routed to services in
the network. TLS Certificates can also be attached to gateways to encrypt
requests between the user and the gateway endpoint.

Because they are separately configured, these configuration entries may be
easily reused. Routes and certificates may be attached to multiple gateways. API
gateways are supported for both Virtual Machines and
[Kubernetes](/consul/docs/api-gateway).
