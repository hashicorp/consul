# Consul K8s Monitoring (Control Plane)

### Number of Consul Servers
- **Metric:** `consul_consul_server_0_consul_members_servers{pod="consul-server-0"}`
- **Description:** Displays the number of Consul servers currently active. This metric provides insight into the cluster's health and the number of Consul nodes running in the environment.

### Number of Connected Consul-dataplanes
- **Metric:** `count(consul_dataplane_envoy_connected)`
- **Description:** Tracks the number of connected Consul dataplanes. This metric helps operators understand how many Envoy sidecars are actively connected to the mesh.

### CPU Usage in Seconds (Consul servers)
- **Metric:** `rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="consul", pod=~"consul-server-.*"}[5m])`
- **Description:** This metric shows the CPU usage of the Consul servers over time, helping operators monitor resource consumption.

### Memory Usage (Consul servers)
- **Metric:** `container_memory_working_set_bytes{container="consul", pod=~"consul-server-.*"}`
- **Description:** Displays the memory usage of the Consul servers. This metric helps ensure that the servers have sufficient memory resources for proper operation.

### Disk Read/Write total per 5 minutes (Consul servers)
- **Metric:** `sum(rate(container_fs_writes_bytes_total{pod=~"consul-server-.*",
 container="consul"}[5m])) by (pod, device)`
- **Metric:** `sum(rate(container_fs_reads_bytes_total{pod=~"consul-server-.*", container="consul"}[5m])) by (pod, device)`
- **Description:** Monitors disk read and write operations over 5-minute intervals for Consul servers. This helps identify potential disk bottlenecks or issues.

### Received bytes total per 5 minutes (Consul servers)
- **Metric:** `sum(rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total{pod=~"consul-server-.*"}[5m])) by (pod)`
- **Description:** Tracks the total network bytes received by Consul servers within a 5-minute window. This metric helps assess the network load on Consul nodes.

### Memory Limit (Consul Servers)
- **Metric:** `kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="memory", pod="consul-server-0"}`
- **Description:** Displays the memory limit for Consul servers. This metric ensures that memory usage stays within the defined limits for each Consul server.

### CPU Limit in Seconds (Consul Servers)
- **Metric:** `kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="cpu", pod="consul-server-0"}`
- **Description:** Displays the CPU limit for Consul servers. Monitoring CPU limits helps operators ensure that the services are not constrained by resource limitations.

### Disk Usage (Consul servers)
- **Metric:** `sum(container_fs_usage_bytes{}) by (pod)`
- **Metric:** `sum(container_fs_usage_bytes{pod="consul-server-0"})`
- **Description:** Shows the amount of filesystem storage used by Consul servers. This metric helps operators track disk usage and plan for capacity.

### CPU Usage in Seconds (Connect Injector)
- **Metric:** `rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~".*-connect-injector-.*",
container="sidecar-injector"}[5m])`
- **Description:** Tracks the CPU usage of the Connect Injector, which is responsible for injecting Envoy sidecars. Monitoring this helps ensure that Connect Injector has adequate CPU resources.

### CPU Limit in Seconds (Connect Injector)
- **Metric:** `max(kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="cpu", container="sidecar-injector"})`
- **Description:** Displays the CPU limit for the Connect Injector. Monitoring the CPU limits ensures that Connect Injector is not constrained by resource limitations.

### Memory Usage (Connect Injector)
- **Metric:** `container_memory_working_set_bytes{pod=~".*-connect-injector-.*",
container="sidecar-injector"}`
- **Description:** Tracks the memory usage of the Connect Injector. Monitoring this helps ensure the Connect Injector has sufficient memory resources.

### Memory Limit (Connect Injector)
- **Metric:** `max(kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource="memory", container="sidecar-injector"})`
- **Description:** Displays the memory limit for the Connect Injector, helping to monitor if the service is nearing its resource limits.
