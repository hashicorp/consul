# Consul server monitoring dashboard

### Raft commit time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_raft_commitTime`
- **Description:** This metric measures the time it takes to commit Raft log entries. Stable values are expected for a healthy cluster. High values can indicate issues with resources such as memory, CPU, or disk space.

### Raft commits per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_raft_apply[5m])`
- **Description:** This metric tracks the rate of Raft log commits emitted by the leader, showing how quickly changes are being applied across the cluster.

### Last contacted leader

- **Grafana query:** `consul_raft_leader_lastContact != 0`
- **Description:** Measures the duration since the last contact with the Raft leader. Spikes in this metric can indicate network issues or an unavailable leader, which may affect cluster stability.

### Election events

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_raft_state_candidate[1m])`, `rate(consul_raft_state_leader[1m])`
- **Description:** Tracks Raft state transitions, indicating leadership elections. Frequent transitions might suggest cluster instability and require investigation.

### Autopilot health

- **Grafana query:** `consul_autopilot_healthy`
- **Description:** A boolean metric that shows a value of 1 when Autopilot is healthy and 0 when issues are detected. Ensures that the cluster has sufficient resources and an operational leader.

### DNS queries per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_dns_domain_query_count[5m])`
- **Description:** This metric tracks the rate of DNS queries per node, bucketed into 5-minute intervals. It helps monitor the query load on Consul’s DNS service.

### DNS domain query time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_dns_domain_query`
- **Description:** Measures the time spent handling DNS domain queries. Spikes in this metric may indicate high contention in the catalog or too many concurrent queries.

### DNS reverse query time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_dns_ptr_query`
- **Description:** Tracks the time spent processing reverse DNS queries. Spikes in query time may indicate performance bottlenecks or increased workload.

### KV applies per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_kvs_apply_count[5m])`
- **Description:** This metric tracks the rate of Key-Value store applies over 5-minute intervals, indicating the operational load on Consul’s KV store.

### KV apply time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_kvs_apply`
- **Description:** Measures the time taken to apply updates to the Key-Value store. Spikes in this metric might suggest resource contention or client overload.

### Transaction apply time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_txn_apply`
- **Description:** Tracks the time spent applying transaction operations in Consul, providing insights into potential bottlenecks in transactional workloads.

### ACL resolves per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_acl_ResolveToken_count[5m])`
- **Description:** This metric tracks the rate of ACL token resolutions per 5-minute intervals. It provides insights into the activity related to ACL tokens within the cluster.

### ACL resolve token time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_acl_ResolveToken`
- **Description:** Measures the time taken to resolve ACL tokens into their associated policies. Spikes in this metric might indicate resource issues or configuration problems.

### ACL updates per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_acl_apply_count[5m])`
- **Description:** Tracks the rate of ACL updates per 5-minute intervals. This metric helps monitor changes in ACL configurations over time.

### ACL apply time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_acl_apply`
- **Description:** Measures the time spent applying ACL changes. Spikes in apply time might suggest resource constraints or high operational load.

### Catalog operations per 5 minutes

- **Grafana query:** `rate(consul_catalog_register_count[5m])`, `rate(consul_catalog_deregister_count[5m])`
- **Description:** Tracks the rate of register and deregister operations in the Consul catalog, providing insights into the churn of services within the cluster.

### Catalog operation time

- **Grafana query:** `consul_catalog_register`, `consul_catalog_deregister`
- **Description:** Measures the time taken to complete catalog register or deregister operations. Spikes in this metric can indicate performance issues within the catalog.
