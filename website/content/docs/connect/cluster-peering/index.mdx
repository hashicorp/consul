# What is Cluster Peering?

->**Cluster peering is currently in technical preview**: Functionality associated with cluster peering is subject to change. You should never use the technical preview release in secure environments or production scenarios. Features in technical preview may have performance issues, scaling issues, and limited support.

You can create peering connections between two or more independent clusters so that services deployed to different partitions or datacenters can to communicate. 

## Overview

Cluster peering allows Consul clusters in different datacenters to communicate with each other. The cluster peering process consists of the following steps:
1. Create a peering token to share with other clusters
1. Establish a connection between clusters
1. Make services available to other clusters

For detailed instructions on setting up cluster peering with the Consul CLI, refer to [Create and Manage Peering Connections](/docs/connect/cluster-peering/create-manage-peering).

### Differences between WAN federation and cluster peering

WAN Federation and cluster peering are different ways to connect clusters. The most important distinction is that WAN Federation assumes clusters are owned by the same operators, so it maintains and replicates global states like ACLs and Configuration Entries. As a result, WAN Federation requires a “primary datacenter" to serve as an authority for replicated data.

Regardless of whether you connect your clusters through WAN Federation or cluster peering, human and machine users can use either method to discover services in other clusters or dial them through the service mesh.

| Uses gossip protocol                             |    &#9989;     |    &#10060;     |

## Technical preview limitations
Not all features and functionality are available in the technical preview release. In particular, be aware of the following limitations:

- Mesh gateways for _service to service traffic_ between clusters are available. However, mesh gateways for _server to server traffic_ are not available.
- Services exported to peered clusters must not be configured as HTTP.
- Support for dynamic routing such as splits, custom routes, or redirects is not available at this time.
- The ``consul intention`` CLI command is not supported.
- [L7 permissions](/docs/connect/l7-traffic) are not supported.
- Configuring service failover across peers is not supported.
- Accessing key/value stores across peers is not supported.
- Consul datacenters that are already federated stay federated.
- Non-enterprise Consul instances cannot sync services with namespaces outside of the default namespace.
