# Manage L7 traffic with cluster peering

This usage topic describes how to configure and apply the [`service-resolver` configuration entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-resolver) to set up redirects and failovers between services that have an existing cluster peering connection.

For Kubernetes-specific guidance for managing L7 traffic with cluster peering, refer to [Manage L7 traffic with cluster peering on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/l7-traffic).

## Service resolvers for redirects and failover

When you use cluster peering to connect datacenters through their admin partitions, you can use [dynamic traffic management](/consul/docs/connect/l7-traffic) to configure your service mesh so that services automatically forward traffic to services hosted on peer clusters.

However, the `service-splitter` and `service-router` configuration entry kinds do not natively support directly targeting a service instance hosted on a peer. Before you can split or route traffic to a service on a peer, you must define the service hosted on the peer as an upstream service by configuring a failover in the `service-resolver` configuration entry. Then, you can set up a redirect in a second service resolver to interact with the peer service by name.

For more information about formatting, updating, and managing configuration entries in Consul, refer to [How to use configuration entries](/consul/docs/agent/config-entries).

## Configure dynamic traffic between peers

To configure L7 traffic management behavior in deployments with cluster peering connections, complete the following steps in order:

1. Define the peer cluster as a failover target in the service resolver configuration.

  The following examples update the [`service-resolver` configuration entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-resolver) in `cluster-01` so that Consul redirects traffic intended for the `frontend` service to a backup instance in peer `cluster-02` when it detects multiple connection failures.

  ```hcl
  Kind           = "service-resolver"
  Name           = "frontend"
  ConnectTimeout = "15s"
  Failover = {
    "*" = {
      Targets = [
        {Peer = "cluster-02"}
      ]   
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
      "ConnectTimeout": "15s",
      "Kind": "service-resolver",
      "Name": "frontend",
      "Failover": {
          "*": {
              "Targets": [
                  {
                      "Peer": "cluster-02"
                  }
              ]
          }
      },
      "CreateIndex": 250,
      "ModifyIndex": 250
  }
  ```

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceResolver
  metadata:
    name: frontend
  spec:
    connectTimeout: 15s
    failover:
      '*':
        targets:
          - peer: 'cluster-02'
            service: 'frontend'
            namespace: 'default'
  ```

  </CodeTabs>

1. Define the desired behavior in `service-splitter` or `service-router` configuration entries.

  The following example splits traffic evenly between `frontend` services hosted on peers by defining the desired behavior locally:

  <CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "JSON", "YAML" ]}>

  ```hcl
  Kind = "service-splitter"
  Name = "frontend"
  Splits = [
    {
      Weight  = 50
      ## defaults to service with same name as configuration entry ("frontend")
    },
    {
      Weight  = 50
      Service = "frontend-peer"
    },
  ]
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "Kind": "service-splitter",
    "Name": "frontend",
    "Splits": [
      {
        "Weight": 50
      },
      {
        "Weight": 50,
        "Service": "frontend-peer"
    }
  ]
  }
  ```

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceSplitter
  metadata:
    name: frontend
  spec:
    splits:
      - weight: 50
        ## defaults to service with same name as configuration entry ("frontend")
      - weight: 50
        service: frontend-peer
  ```

  </CodeTabs>

1. Create a local `service-resolver` configuration entry named `frontend-peer` and define a redirect targeting the peer and its service:

  <CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "JSON", "YAML" ]}>

  ```hcl
  Kind           = "service-resolver"
  Name           = "frontend-peer"
  Redirect {
    Service = frontend
    Peer = "cluster-02"
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "Kind": "service-resolver",
    "Name": "frontend-peer",
    "Redirect": {
      "Service": "frontend",
      "Peer": "cluster-02"
    }
  }
  ```

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceResolver
  metadata:
    name: frontend-peer
  spec:
    redirect:
      peer: 'cluster-02'
      service: 'frontend'
  ```
