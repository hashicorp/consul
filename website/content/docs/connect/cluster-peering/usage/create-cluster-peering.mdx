# Establish Cluster Peering Connections

A peering token enables cluster peering between different datacenters. Once you generate a peering token, you can use it to establish a connection between clusters. Then you can export services and create intentions so that peered clusters can call those services.

The process to create a peering connection is a sequence with multiple steps:

1. Create a peering token
1. Establish a connection between clusters
1. Export services between clusters
1. Authorize services for peers

You can generate peering tokens and initiate connections on any available agent using either the API, CLI, or the Consul UI. If you use the API or CLI, we recommend performing these operations through a client agent in the partition you want to connect.

The UI does not currently support exporting services between clusters or authorizing services for peers.

## Create a peering token

To begin the cluster peering process, generate a peering token in one of your clusters. The other cluster uses this token to establish the peering connection.

Every time you generate a peering token, a single-use establishment secret is embedded in the token. Because regenerating a peering token invalidates the previously generated secret, you must use the most recently created token to establish peering connections.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Consul API" group="api">

In `cluster-01`, use the [`/peering/token` endpoint](/api-docs/peering#generate-a-peering-token) to issue a request for a peering token.

```shell-session
$ curl --request POST --data '{"Peer":"cluster-02"}' --url http://localhost:8500/v1/peering/token
```

The CLI outputs the peering token, which is a base64-encoded string containing the token details.

Create a JSON file that contains the first cluster's name and the peering token.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="peering_token.json" hideClipboard>

```json
{
    "Peer": "cluster-01",
    "PeeringToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsImF1ZCI6IlNvbHIifQ.5T7L_L1MPfQ_5FjKGa1fTPqrzwK4bNSM812nW6oyjb8"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
</Tab>

<Tab heading="Consul CLI" group="cli">

In `cluster-01`, use the [`consul peering generate-token` command](/commands/peering/generate-token) to issue a request for a peering token.

```shell-session
$ consul peering generate-token -name cluster-02
```

The CLI outputs the peering token, which is a base64-encoded string containing the token details.
Save this value to a file or clipboard to be used in the next step on `cluster-02`.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Consul UI" group="ui">

1. In the Consul UI for the datacenter associated with `cluster-01`, click **Peers**.
1. Click **Add peer connection**.
1. In the **Generate token** tab, enter `cluster-02` in the **Name of peer** field.
1. Click the **Generate token** button.
1. Copy the token before you proceed. You cannot view it again after leaving this screen. If you lose your token, you must generate a new one.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Establish a connection between clusters

Next, use the peering token to establish a secure connection between the clusters.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Consul API" group="api">

In one of the client agents in "cluster-02," use `peering_token.json` and the [`/peering/establish` endpoint](/api-docs/peering#establish-a-peering-connection) to establish the peering connection. This endpoint does not generate an output unless there is an error.

```shell-session
$ curl --request POST --data @peering_token.json http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/peering/establish
```

When you connect server agents through cluster peering, their default behavior is to peer to the `default` partition. To establish peering connections for other partitions through server agents, you must add the `Partition` field to `peering_token.json` and specify the partitions you want to peer. For additional configuration information, refer to [Cluster Peering - HTTP API](/api-docs/peering).

You can dial the `peering/establish` endpoint once per peering token. Peering tokens cannot be reused after being used to establish a connection. If you need to re-establish a connection, you must generate a new peering token.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Consul CLI" group="cli">

In one of the client agents in "cluster-02," issue the [`consul peering establish` command](/commands/peering/establish) and specify the token generated in the previous step. The command establishes the peering connection.
The commands prints "Successfully established peering connection with cluster-01" after the connection is established.

```shell-session
$ consul peering establish -name cluster-01 -peering-token token-from-generate
```

When you connect server agents through cluster peering, they peer their default partitions.
To establish peering connections for other partitions through server agents, you must add the `-partition` flag to the `establish` command and specify the partitions you want to peer.
For additional configuration information, refer to [`consul peering establish` command](/commands/peering/establish) .

You can run the `peering establish` command once per peering token.
Peering tokens cannot be reused after being used to establish a connection.
If you need to re-establish a connection, you must generate a new peering token.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Consul UI" group="ui">

1. In the Consul UI for the datacenter associated with `cluster 02`, click **Peers** and then **Add peer connection**.
1. Click **Establish peering**.
1. In the **Name of peer** field, enter `cluster-01`. Then paste the peering token in the **Token** field.
1. Click **Add peer**.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Export services between clusters

After you establish a connection between the clusters, you need to create a configuration entry that defines the services that are available for other clusters. Consul uses this configuration entry to advertise service information and support service mesh connections across clusters.

First, create a configuration entry and specify the `Kind` as `"exported-services"`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="peering-config.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
Kind = "exported-services"
Name = "default"
Services = [
  {
    ## The name and namespace of the service to export.
    Name      = "service-name"
    Namespace = "default"

    ## The list of peer clusters to export the service to.
    Consumers = [
      {
        ## The peer name to reference in config is the one set
        ## during the peering process.
        Peer = "cluster-02"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Then, add the configuration entry to your cluster.

```shell-session
$ consul config write peering-config.hcl
```

Before you proceed, wait for the clusters to sync and make services available to their peers. You can issue an endpoint query to [check the peered cluster status](#check-peered-cluster-status).

### Authorize services for peers

Before you can call services from peered clusters, you must set service intentions that authorize those clusters to use specific services. Consul prevents services from being exported to unauthorized clusters.

First, create a configuration entry and specify the `Kind` as `"service-intentions"`. Declare the service on "cluster-02" that can access the service in "cluster-01." The following example sets service intentions so that "frontend-service" can access "backend-service."

<CodeBlockConfig filename="peering-intentions.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
Kind      = "service-intentions"
Name      = "backend-service"

Sources = [
  {
    Name   = "frontend-service"
    Peer   = "cluster-02"
    Action = "allow"
  }
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If the peer's name is not specified in `Peer`, then Consul assumes that the service is in the local cluster.

Then, add the configuration entry to your cluster.

```shell-session
$ consul config write peering-intentions.hcl
```

### Authorize Service Reads with ACLs

If ACLs are enabled on a Consul cluster, sidecar proxies that access exported services as an upstream must have an ACL token that grants read access. 
Read access to all imported services is granted using either of the following rules associated with an ACL token:
- `service:write` permissions for any service in the sidecar's partition.
- `service:read` and `node:read` for all services and nodes, respectively, in sidecar's namespace and partition.
For Consul Enterprise, access is granted to all imported services in the service's partition.
These permissions are satisfied when using a [service identity](/docs/security/acl/acl-roles#service-identities). 

Example rule files can be found in [Reading Servers](/docs/connect/config-entries/exported-services#reading-services) in the `exported-services` config entry documentation.

Refer to [ACLs System Overview](/docs/security/acl) for more information on ACLs and their setup.
