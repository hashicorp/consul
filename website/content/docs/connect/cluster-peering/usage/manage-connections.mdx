# Manage cluster peering connections

This usage topic describes how to manage cluster peering connections using the CLI, the HTTP API, and the UI.

After you establish a cluster peering connection, you can get a list of all active peering connections, read a specific peering connection's information, and delete peering connections.

For Kubernetes-specific guidance for managing cluster peering connections, refer to [Manage cluster peering connections on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/manage-peering).

## List all peering connections

You can list all active peering connections in a cluster.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Consul CLI" group="cli">

  ```shell-session 
  $ consul peering list
  Name        State    Imported Svcs  Exported Svcs  Meta
  cluster-02  ACTIVE   0              2              env=production
  cluster-03  PENDING  0              0
  ```

For more information, including optional flags and parameters, refer to the [`consul peering list` CLI command reference](/consul/commands/peering/list).

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HTTP API" group="api">

The following example shows how to format an API request to list peering connections:

  ```shell-session
  $ curl --header "X-Consul-Token: 0137db51-5895-4c25-b6cd-d9ed992f4a52" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/peerings
  ```

For more information, including optional parameters and sample responses, refer to the [`/peering` endpoint reference](/consul/api-docs/peering#list-all-peerings).

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Consul UI" group="ui">

In the Consul UI, click **Peers**.

The UI lists peering connections you created for clusters in a datacenter. The name that appears in the list is the name of the cluster in a different datacenter with an established peering connection.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Read a peering connection

You can get information about individual peering connections between clusters.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Consul CLI" group="cli">

The following example outputs information about a peering connection locally referred to as "cluster-02":

  ```shell-session
  $ consul peering read -name cluster-02
  Name:         cluster-02
  ID:           3b001063-8079-b1a6-764c-738af5a39a97
  State:        ACTIVE
  Meta:
      env=production

  Peer ID:               e83a315c-027e-bcb1-7c0c-a46650904a05
  Peer Server Name:      server.dc1.consul
  Peer CA Pems:          0
  Peer Server Addresses:
      10.0.0.1:8300

  Imported Services: 0
  Exported Services: 2

  Create Index: 89
  Modify Index: 89
  ```

For more information, including optional flags and parameters, refer to the [`consul peering read` CLI command reference](/consul/commands/peering/read).

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HTTP API" group="api">

  ```shell-session
  $ curl --header "X-Consul-Token: b23b3cad-5ea1-4413-919e-c76884b9ad60" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/peering/cluster-02
  ```

For more information, including optional parameters and sample responses, refer to the [`/peering` endpoint reference](/consul/api-docs/peering#read-a-peering-connection).

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Consul UI" group="ui">

1. In the Consul UI, click **Peers**.

1. Click the name of a peered cluster to view additional details about the peering connection.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Delete peering connections

You can disconnect the peered clusters by deleting their connection. Deleting a peering connection stops data replication to the peer and deletes imported data, including services and CA certificates.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Consul CLI" group="cli">

  The following examples deletes a peering connection to a cluster locally referred to as "cluster-02":

  ```shell-session 
  $ consul peering delete -name cluster-02
  Successfully submitted peering connection, cluster-02, for deletion
  ```

For more information, including optional flags and parameters, refer to the [`consul peering delete` CLI command reference](/consul/commands/peering/delete).

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HTTP API" group="api">

  ```shell-session
  $ curl --request DELETE --header "X-Consul-Token: b23b3cad-5ea1-4413-919e-c76884b9ad60" http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/peering/cluster-02
  ```

This endpoint does not return a response. For more information, including optional parameters, refer to the [`/peering` endpoint reference](/consul/api-docs/peering#delete-a-peering-connection).
</Tab>
<Tab heading="Consul UI" group="ui">

1. In the Consul UI, click **Peers**. The UI lists peering connections you created for clusters in that datacenter.
1. Next to the name of the peer, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Delete**.
1. Click **Delete** to confirm and remove the peering connection.
