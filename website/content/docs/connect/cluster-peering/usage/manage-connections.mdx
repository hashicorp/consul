# Manage Cluster Peering Connections

After you establish a cluster peering connection, you can get a list of all active peering connections, read a specific peering connection's information, and delete peering connections.

This page describes how to use the Consul UI to manage cluster peering connections. To manage cluster peering through the HTTP API, refer to the [`/peering` endpoint reference](/consul/api-docs/peering). If you prefer to use the command line, refer to [`peering` CLI command reference](/consul/commands/peering).

## List all peering connections

You can list all active peering connections in a cluster.

In the Consul UI, click **Peers**. The UI lists peering connections you created for clusters in a datacenter. The name that appears in the list is the name of the cluster in a different datacenter with an established peering connection.

## Read a peering connection

You can get information about individual peering connections between clusters.

In the Consul UI, click **Peers**. The UI lists peering connections you created for clusters in that datacenter. Click the name of a peered cluster to view additional details about the peering connection.

## Delete peering connections

You can disconnect the peered clusters by deleting their connection. Deleting a peering connection stops data replication to the peer and deletes imported data, including services and CA certificates.

In the Consul UI, click **Peers**. The UI lists peering connections you created for clusters in that datacenter.

Next to the name of the peer, click **More** (three horizontal dots) and then **Delete**. Click **Delete** to confirm and remove the peering connection.
