# Cluster peering technical specifications

This reference topic describes the technical specifications associated with using cluster peering in your deployments. These specifications include required Consul components and their configurations. To learn more about Consul's cluster peering feature, refer to [cluster peering overview](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering).

For cluster peering requirements in Kubernetes deployments, refer to [cluster peering on Kubernetes technical specifications](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/tech-specs).

## Requirements

To use cluster peering features, make sure your Consul environment meets the following prerequisites:

- Consul v1.14 or higher.
- A local Consul agent is required to manage mesh gateway configuration.
- Use [Envoy proxies](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy). Envoy is the only proxy with mesh gateway capabilities in Consul.

In addition, the following service mesh components are required in order to establish cluster peering connections:
  
- [Cluster peering technical specifications](#cluster-peering-technical-specifications)
  - [Requirements](#requirements)
    - [Mesh gateway requirements](#mesh-gateway-requirements)
      - [Mesh gateway modes](#mesh-gateway-modes)
  - [Sidecar proxy requirements](#sidecar-proxy-requirements)
  - [Exported service requirements](#exported-service-requirements)
  - [ACL requirements](#acl-requirements)

### Mesh gateway requirements

Mesh gateways are required for routing service mesh traffic between partitions with cluster peering connections. Consider the following general requirements for mesh gateways when using cluster peering:

- A cluster requires a registered mesh gateway in order to export services to peers.
- For Enterprise, this mesh gateway must also be registered in the same partition as the exported services and their `exported-services` configuration entry.
- To use the `local` mesh gateway mode, you must register a mesh gateway in the importing cluster.

In addition, you must define the `Proxy.Config` settings using opaque parameters compatible with your proxy. Refer to the [Gateway options](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#gateway-options) and [Escape-hatch Overrides](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#escape-hatch-overrides) documentation for additional Envoy proxy configuration information.

#### Mesh gateway modes

By default, all cluster peering connections use mesh gateways in [remote mode](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway/service-to-service-traffic-wan-datacenters#remote). Be aware of these additional requirements when changing a mesh gateway's mode.

- For mesh gateways that connect peered clusters, you can set the `mode` as either `remote` or `local`.
- The `none` mode is invalid for mesh gateways with cluster peering connections.

Refer to [mesh gateway modes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway#modes) for more information.

## Sidecar proxy requirements

The Envoy proxies that function as sidecars in your service mesh require configuration in order to properly route traffic to peers. Sidecar proxies are defined in the [service definition](/consul/docs/services/usage/define-services).

- Configure the `proxy.upstreams` parameters to route traffic to the correct service, namespace, and peer. Refer to the [`upstreams`](/consul/docs/connect/registration/service-registration#upstream-configuration-reference) documentation for details.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_name` parameter is always required.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_peer` parameter must be configured to enable cross-cluster traffic.
- The `proxy.upstream/destination_namespace` configuration is only necessary if the destination service is in a non-default namespace.

## Exported service requirements

The `exported-services` configuration entry is required in order for services to communicate across partitions with cluster peering connections.

Basic guidance on using the `exported-services` configuration entry is included in [Establish cluster peering connections](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/establish-peering).

Refer to the [`exported-services` configuration entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/exported-services) reference for more information.

## ACL requirements

If ACLs are enabled, you must add tokens to grant the following permissions:

- Grant `service:write` permissions to services that define mesh gateways in their server definition.
- Grant `service:read` permissions for all services on the partition.
- Grant `mesh:write` permissions to the mesh gateways that participate in cluster peering connections. This permission allows a leaf certificate to be issued for mesh gateways to terminate TLS sessions for HTTP requests.
