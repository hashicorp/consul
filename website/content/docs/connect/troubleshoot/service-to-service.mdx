# Troubleshoot service-to-service communication

This page describes the process for troubleshooting service-to-service communication in a service mesh using the `consul troubleshoot` CLI command.

## Overview

Using the service-to-service troubleshooting tool is a two-step process:

1. Find the identifier for the upstream service.
1. Use the upstream’s identifier to validate communication.

In deployments without transparent proxies, the identifier is the _Envoy ID for the upstream service’s sidecar proxy_. If you use transparent proxies, the identifier is the _upstream service’s IP address_. For more information about using transparent proxies, refer to [Enable transparent proxy mode](/consul/docs/connect/transparent-proxy).

## Requirements

- Consul v1.15 or later.
- For Kubernetes, the `consul-k8s` CLI must be installed.

## Troubleshoot on VMs

To troubleshoot service-to-service communication issues in deployments that use VMs or bare-metal servers:

1. Run the `consul troubleshoot upstreams` command to retrieve the upstream information for the service that is experiencing communication failures. Depending on your network’s configuration, the upstream information is either an Envoy ID or an IP address.

  ```shell-session
  $ consul troubleshoot upstreams
  ==> Upstreams (explicit upstreams only) (0)
  ==> Upstreams IPs (transparent proxy only) (1)
  [10.4.6.160 240.0.0.3] true map[backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul]
  If you cannot find the upstream address or cluster for a transparent proxy upstream:
    - Check intentions: Tproxy upstreams are configured based on intentions. Make sure you have configured intentions to allow traffic to your upstream.
    - To check that the right cluster is being dialed, run a DNS lookup for the upstream you are dialing. For example, run `dig backend.svc.consul` to return the IP address for the `backend` service. If the address you get from that is missing from the upstream IPs, it means that your proxy may be misconfigured.
  ```

1. Run the `consul troubleshoot proxy` command and specify the  Envoy ID or IP address with the `-upstream-ip` flag to identify the proxy you want to perform the troubleshooting process on. The following example uses the upstream IP to validate communication with the upstream service `backend`:

  ```shell-session
  $ consul troubleshoot proxy -upstream-ip 10.4.6.160
  ==> Validation
  ✓ Certificates are valid
  ✓ Envoy has 0 rejected configurations
  ✓ Envoy has detected 0 connection failure(s)
  ✓ Listener for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Route for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Healthy endpoints for cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ! No healthy endpoints for cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
    -> Check that your upstream service is healthy and running
    -> Check that your upstream service is registered with Consul
    -> Check that the upstream proxy is healthy and running
    -> If you are explicitly configuring upstreams, ensure the name of the upstream is correct
  ```

In the example output, troubleshooting upstream communication reveals that the `backend` service has two service instances running in datacenter `dc1`. One of the services is healthy, but Consul cannot detect healthy endpoints for the second service instance. This information appears in the following lines of the example:

```text hideClipboard
  ✓ Cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Healthy endpoints for cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ Cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ! No healthy endpoints for cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
```

The output from the troubleshooting process identifies service instances according to their [Consul DNS address](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-static-lookups#standard-lookup). Use the DNS information for failing services to diagnose the specific issues affecting the service instance.

For more information, refer to the [`consul troubleshoot` CLI documentation](/consul/commands/troubleshoot).

## Troubleshoot on Kubernetes

To troubleshoot service-to-service communication issues in deployments that use Kubernetes, retrieve the upstream information for the pod that is experiencing communication failures and use the upstream information to identify the proxy you want to perform the troubleshooting process on.

1. Run the `consul-k8s troubleshoot upstreams` command and specify the pod ID with the `-pod` flag to retrieve upstream information. Depending on your network’s configuration, the upstream information is either an Envoy ID or an IP address. The following example displays all transparent proxy upstreams in Consul service mesh from the given pod.

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-k8s troubleshoot upstreams -pod frontend-767ccfc8f9-6f6gx
  ==> Upstreams (explicit upstreams only) (0)
  ==> Upstreams IPs (transparent proxy only) (1)
  [10.4.6.160 240.0.0.3] true map[backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul]
  If you cannot find the upstream address or cluster for a transparent proxy upstream:
    - Check intentions: Tproxy upstreams are configured based on intentions. Make sure you have configured intentions to allow traffic to your upstream.
    - To check that the right cluster is being dialed, run a DNS lookup for the upstream you are dialing. For example, run `dig backend.svc.consul` to return the IP address for the `backend` service. If the address you get from that is missing from the upstream IPs, it means that your proxy may be misconfigured.
  ```

1. Run the `consul-k8s troubleshoot proxy` command and specify the pod ID and upstream IP address to identify the proxy you want to troubleshoot. The following example uses the upstream IP to validate communication with the upstream service `backend`:

  ```shell-session
  $ consul-k8s troubleshoot proxy -pod frontend-767ccfc8f9-6f6gx -upstream-ip 10.4.6.160
  ==> Validation
  ✓ certificates are valid
  ✓ Envoy has 0 rejected configurations
  ✓ Envoy has detected 0 connection failure(s)
  ✓ listener for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ route for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal..consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ healthy endpoints for cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal..consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ! no healthy endpoints for cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ```

In the example output, troubleshooting upstream communication reveals that the `backend` service has two clusters in datacenter `dc1`. One of the clusters returns healthy endpoints, but Consul cannot detect healthy endpoints for the second cluster. This information appears in the following lines of the example:

  ```text hideClipboard
  ✓ cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal..consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ healthy endpoints for cluster "backend.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ✓ cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal..consul" for upstream "backend" found
  ! no healthy endpoints for cluster "backend2.default.dc1.internal.e08fa6d6-e91e-dfe0-f6e1-ba097a828e31.consul" for upstream "backend" found
```

The output from the troubleshooting process identifies service instances according to their [Consul DNS address](/consul/docs/k8s/dns). Use the DNS information for failing services to diagnose the specific issues affecting the service instance.
