# Service Defaults

-> **v1.8.4+:** On Kubernetes, the `ServiceDefaults` custom resource is supported in Consul versions 1.8.4+.<br />
**v1.5.0+:** On other platforms, this config entry is supported in Consul versions 1.5.0+.

The `service-defaults` config entry kind (`ServiceDefaults` on Kubernetes) controls default global values for a
service, such as its protocol.

## Sample Config Entries

### Default protocol

-> **NOTE**: The default protocol can also be configured globally for all proxies
using the [proxy defaults](/docs/connect/config-entries/proxy-defaults#default-protocol)
config entry. However, if the protocol value is specified in a service defaults
config entry for a given service, that value will take precedence over the
globally configured value from proxy defaults.

Set the default protocol for a service in the default namespace to HTTP:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind      = "service-defaults"
Name      = "web"
Namespace = "default"
Protocol  = "http"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  protocol: http
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-defaults",
  "Name": "web",

  "Protocol": "http"
}
```

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by [ACLs](/docs/security/acl).

Reading a `service-defaults` config entry requires `service:read` on the resource.

Creating, updating, or deleting a `service-defaults` config entry requires
`service:write` on the resource.
