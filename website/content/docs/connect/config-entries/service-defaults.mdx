  The service defaults configuration entry kind defines sets of default configurations that apply to all services in the mesh. Use the examples learn how to define a default protocol, default upstream configuration, and default terminating gateway.

# Service Defaults Configuration Entry

-> **v1.8.4+:** On Kubernetes, the `ServiceDefaults` custom resource is supported in Consul versions 1.8.4+.<br />
**v1.5.0+:** On other platforms, this config entry is supported in Consul versions 1.5.0+.

The `service-defaults` config entry kind (`ServiceDefaults` on Kubernetes) controls default global values for a
service, such as its protocol.

## Sample Config Entries

### Default protocol

-> **NOTE**: The default protocol can also be configured globally for all proxies
using the [proxy defaults](/docs/connect/config-entries/proxy-defaults#default-protocol)
config entry. However, if the protocol value is specified in a service defaults
config entry for a given service, that value will take precedence over the
globally configured value from proxy defaults.

Set the default protocol for a service in the default namespace to HTTP:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind      = "service-defaults"
Name      = "web"
Namespace = "default"
Protocol  = "http"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  protocol: http
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-defaults",
  "Name": "web",
  "Namespace": "default",
  "Protocol": "http"
}
```

### Upstream configuration

### Terminating gateway destination

Create a default destination that will be assigned to a terminating gateway. A destination
represents a location outside the Consul cluster. They can be dialed directly when transparent proxy mode is enabled.

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

  ```hcl
  Kind = "service-defaults"
  Name = "test-destination"
  Protocol = "tcp"
  Destination {
    Addresses = ["test.com","test.org"]
    Port = 443
  }
  ```

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ServiceDefaults
  metadata:
    name: test-destination
  spec:
    destination:
      addresses:
        - "test.com"
        - "test.org"
      port: 443
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "Kind": "service-defaults",
    "Name": "test-destination",
    "Protocol": "http",
    "Destination": {
      "Addresses": ["test.com","test.org"],
      "Port": 443

                     itself. Instead it signals Consul to configure Envoy as if traffic is already being redirected.
                    \`direct\` represents that the proxy's listeners must be dialed directly by the local
                    application and other proxies.
