page_title: Service Resolver - Configuration Entry Reference
description: >-
  The service resolver configuration entry kind defines subsets of service instances that satisfy upstream discovery requests. Use the reference guide to learn about `""service-resolver""` config entry parameters and how filtering by service subsets helps route traffic based on properties like version number.

# Service Resolver Configuration Entry

-> **v1.8.4+:** On Kubernetes, the `ServiceResolver` custom resource is supported in Consul versions 1.8.4+.<br />
**v1.6.0+:** On other platforms, this config entry is supported in Consul versions 1.6.0+.

The `service-resolver` config entry kind (`ServiceResolver` on Kubernetes) controls which service instances
should satisfy Connect upstream discovery requests for a given service name.

If no resolver config is defined the chain assumes 100% of traffic goes to the
healthy instances of the default service in the current datacenter+namespace
and discovery terminates.

## Interaction with other Config Entries

- Service resolver config entries are a component of [L7 Traffic
  Management](/docs/connect/l7-traffic).

## UI

Once a `service-resolver` is successfully entered, you can view it in the UI. Service routers, service splitters, and service resolvers can all be viewed by clicking on your service then switching to the *routing* tab.

## Sample Config Entries

### Filter on service version

Create service subsets based on a version metadata and override the defaults:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind          = "service-resolver"
Name          = "web"
DefaultSubset = "v1"
Subsets = {
  v1 = {
    Filter = "Service.Meta.version == v1"
  }
  v2 = {
    Filter = "Service.Meta.version == v2"
  }
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  defaultSubset: v1
  subsets:
    v1:
      filter: 'Service.Meta.version == v1'
    v2:
      filter: 'Service.Meta.version == v2'
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-resolver",
  "Name": "web",
  "DefaultSubset": "v1",
  "Subsets": {
    "v1": {
      "Filter": "Service.Meta.version == v1"
    },
    "v2": {
      "Filter": "Service.Meta.version == v2"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Other datacenters

Expose a set of services in another datacenter as a virtual service:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind = "service-resolver"
Name = "web-dc2"
Redirect {
  Service    = "web"
  Datacenter = "dc2"
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: web-dc2
spec:
  redirect:
    service: web
    datacenter: dc2
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-resolver",
  "Name": "web-dc2",
  "Redirect": {
    "Service": "web",
    "Datacenter": "dc2"
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

### Failover

Enable failover for subset `v2` to `dc2`, and all other subsets to `dc3` or `dc4`:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind           = "service-resolver"
Name           = "web"
ConnectTimeout = "15s"
Failover = {
  v2 = {
    Datacenters = ["dc2"]
  }
  "*" = {
    Datacenters = ["dc3", "dc4"]
  }
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  connectTimeout: 15s
  failover:
    v2:
      datacenters: ['dc2']
    '*':
      datacenters: ['dc3', 'dc4']
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-resolver",
  "Name": "web",
  "ConnectTimeout": "15s",
  "Failover": {
    "v2": {
      "Datacenters": ["dc2"]
    },
    "*": {
      "Datacenters": ["dc3", "dc4"]
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

Enable failover to a WAN federated datacenter and then a cluster peer for all
service subsets.

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind           = "service-resolver"
Name           = "web"
ConnectTimeout = "15s"
Failover = {
  "*" = {
    Targets = [
      {Datacenter = "dc3"},
      {Peer = "peer-01"}
    ]
  }
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  connectTimeout: 15s
  failover:
    '*':
      targets:
      - datacenter: "dc3"
      - peer: "peer-01"
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-resolver",
  "Name": "web",
  "ConnectTimeout": "15s",
  "Failover": {
    "*": {
      "Targets": [
        {"Datacenter": "dc3"},
        {"Peer": "peer-01"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Consistent load balancing

Apply consistent load balancing for requests based on `x-user-id` header:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind = "service-resolver"
Name = "web"

LoadBalancer = {
  Policy = "maglev"
  HashPolicies = [
    {
      Field = "header"
      FieldValue = "x-user-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  loadBalancer:
    policy: maglev
    hashPolicies:
      - field: header
        fieldValue: x-user-id
```

```json
{
  "Kind": "service-resolver",
  "Name": "web",
  "LoadBalancer": {
    "Policy": "maglev",
    "HashPolicies": [
      {

        "FieldValue": "x-user-id"
      }
    ]

                  When the peer name is specified, Consul uses Envoy's outlier detection

                  whether communication attempts to the failover target are generally successful.
                  Service health checks imported from a peer are not considered in the health
                  of a failover target because they do not account for service routers, splitters, and resolvers

## Service Subsets

A service subset assigns a concrete name to a specific subset of discoverable
service instances within a datacenter, such as `"version2"` or `"canary"`.

A service subset name is useful only when composed with an actual service name,
a specific datacenter, and namespace.

All services have an unnamed default subset that will return all healthy
instances unfiltered.

Subsets are defined in `service-resolver` configuration entries, but are
referenced by their names throughout the other configuration entry kinds.

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by [ACLs](/docs/security/acl).

Reading a `service-resolver` config entry requires `service:read` on the resource.

Creating, updating, or deleting a `service-resolver` config entry requires
`service:write` on the resource and `service:read` on any other service referenced by
name in these fields:

- [`Redirect.Service`](#service)

- [`Failover[].Service`](#service-1)
