# Service Intentions Configuration Entry ((#service-intentions))

-> **1.9.0+:** This config entry is available in Consul versions 1.9.0 and newer.

The `service-intentions` config entry kind (`ServiceIntentions` on Kubernetes) controls Connect traffic
authorization for both networking layer 4 (e.g. TCP) and networking layer 7
(e.g. HTTP).

Service intentions config entries represent a collection of
[intentions](/docs/connect/intentions) sharing a specific destination. All
intentions governing access to a specific destination are stored in a single
`service-intentions` config entry.

A single config entry may define a mix of both L4 and L7 style intentions, but
for a specific source L4 and L7 intentions are mutually exclusive. Only one
will apply at a time. Default behavior for L4 is configurable (regardless of
global setting) by defining a low precedence intention for that destination.

## Interaction with other Config Entries

L7 intentions within a config entry are restricted to only destination services
that define their protocol as HTTP-based via a corresponding
[`service-defaults`](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-defaults) config entry
or globally via [`proxy-defaults`](/docs/connect/config-entries/proxy-defaults) .

## Sample Config Entries

The following examples demonstrate potential use-cases for the `service-intentions` configuration entry.

### REST Access

In the following example, the `admin-dashboard` and `report-generator` services have different levels of access when making REST calls:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl
Kind = "service-intentions"

        HTTP {

          Methods    = ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"]
        }
      }

        }
      }
    ]
  }
  # NOTE: a default catch-all based on the default ACL policy will apply to
  # unmatched connections and requests. Typically this will be DENY.
]
```

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### gRPC

In the following use-case, access to the `IssueRefund` gRPC service method is set to `deny`. Because gRPC method calls [are
HTTP/2](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md), an HTTP path-matching rule can be used to control traffic:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "Kubernetes YAML", "JSON" ]}>

```hcl

      # issuing refunds.
      {
        Action = "deny"
        HTTP {
          PathExact = "/mycompany.BillingService/IssueRefund"

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by [ACLs](/docs/security/acl).

Reading a `service-intentions` config entry requires `intentions:read` on the resource.

Creating, updating, or deleting a `service-intentions` config entry requires
`intentions:write` on the resource.

Intention ACL rules are specified as part of a `service` rule. See [Intention
Management Permissions](/docs/connect/intentions#intention-management-permissions) for
more details.

## Regular Expression Syntax

The actual syntax of the regular expression fields described here is entirely
proxy-specific.

When using [Envoy](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) as a proxy, the syntax for
these fields is [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).
