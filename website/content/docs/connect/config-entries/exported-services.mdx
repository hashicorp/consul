# Exported Services Configuration Entry

This topic describes the `exported-services` configuration entry type. The `exported-services` configuration entry enables Consul to export service instances to other clusters from a single file and connect services across clusters. For additional information, refer to [Cluster Peering](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering) and [Admin Partitions](/consul/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions).

## Introduction

To configure Consul to export services contained in a Consul Enterprise admin partition or Consul OSS datacenter to one or more additional clusters, create a new configuration entry and declare `exported-services` in the `kind` field. This configuration entry enables you to route traffic between services in different clusters.

You can configure the settings defined in the `exported-services` configuration entry to apply to all namespaces in a Consul Enterprise admin partition.

## Requirements
- **Enterprise Only**: A corresponding partition that the configuration entry can export from. For example, the `exported-services` configuration entry for a partition named `frontend` requires an existing `frontend` partition.

## Usage

1. Verify that your datacenter meets the conditions specified in the [Requirements](#requirements).
1. Specify the `exported-services` configuration in the agent configuration file (see [`config_entries`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#config_entries)) as described in [Configuration](#configuration).
1. Apply the configuration using one of the following methods:
   - Kubernetes CRD: Refer to the [Custom Resource Definitions](/consul/docs/k8s/crds) documentation for details.
   - Issue the `consul config write` command: Refer to the [Consul Config Write](/consul/commands/config/write) documentation for details.

## Configuration

Configure the following parameters to define a `exported-services` configuration entry:

### Configuration Parameters

The following table describes the parameters associated with the `exported-services` configuration entry.

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                   | Required | Default |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |

### Services

The `Services` parameter contains a list of one or more parameters that specify which services to export, which namespaces the services reside, and the destination cluster for the exported services. Each item in the `Services` list must contain the following parameters:

- `Name`: Specifies the name of the service to export. You can use an asterisk wildcard (`*`) to include all services in the namespace.
- `Namespace`: <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Specifies the namespace containing the services to export. You can use an asterisk wildcard (`*`) to include all namespaces in the partition.
- `Consumers`: Specifies one or more objects that identify a destination cluster for the exported services.

### Consumers

The `Consumers` parameter contains a list of one or more parameters that specify the destination cluster for
an exported service. Each item in the `Consumers` list must contain exactly one of the following parameters:

- `Peer`: Specifies the name of the peered cluster to export the service to.
A asterisk wildcard (`*`) cannot be specified as the `Peer`. Added in Consul 1.13.0.
- `Partition`: <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Specifies an admin partition in the datacenter to export the service to.
A asterisk wildcard (`*`) cannot be specified as the `Partition`.

## Reading Services

When an exported service has been imported to another cluster, you can use the `health` REST API endpoint to query the service on the consumer cluster.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Consul OSS">

The following example queries the `finance` peer for the imported `payments` service:

```shell-session
$ curl 'localhost:8500/v1/health/service/payments?peer=finance'
```
An ACL token with either of the following permissions is required in the cluster where the query is made:
- `service:write` permissions for any service.
- `service:read` and `node:read` for all services and nodes, respectively.

If the call in the previous example is made from a service named `web`, then the request requires either:
- A token with `service:write` permissions to `web`.
- A token with `service:read` and `node:read` to all names in the datacenter.

<CodeTabs heading="Example ACL rules for reading imported services in Consul OSS">

```hcl
service "web" {
    policy = "write"

The following example queries the `finance` partition for the imported `payments` service:

```shell-session

An ACL token with either of the following permissions is required in the cluster where the query is made:
- `service:write` permissions for any service in the partition where the query is made.
- `service:read` and `node:read` for all services and nodes, respectively, in any namespace and the exact partition where the query is made.

If the call in the previous example is made from a service named `web` in a partition named `frontend`, then the request requires either:
- A token with `service:write` permissions to `web` in the `frontend` partition.
- A token with `service:read` and `node:read` to all names in the `frontend` partition, for any namespace.
