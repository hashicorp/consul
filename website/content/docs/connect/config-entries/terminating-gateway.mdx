page_title: Terminating Gateway - Configuration Entry Reference
description: >-
  The terminating gateway configuration entry kind defines behavior to secure outgoing communication between the service mesh and non-mesh services. Use the reference guide to learn about `""terminating-gateway""` config entry parameters and connecting from your service mesh to external or non-mesh services registered with Consul.

# Terminating Gateway Configuration Entry

The `terminating-gateway` config entry kind (`TerminatingGateway` on Kubernetes) allows you to configure terminating gateways
to proxy traffic from services in the Consul service mesh to services registered with Consul that do not have a
[service mesh sidecar proxy](/consul/docs/connect/proxies). The configuration is associated with the name of a gateway service
and will apply to all instances of the gateway with that name.

~> [Configuration entries](/consul/docs/agent/config-entries) are global in scope. A configuration entry for a gateway name applies
across all federated Consul datacenters. If terminating gateways in different Consul datacenters need to route to different
sets of services within their datacenter then the terminating gateways **must** be registered with different names.

See [Terminating Gateway](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/terminating-gateway) for more information.

## TLS Origination

By specifying a path to a [CA file](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/terminating-gateway#cafile) connections
from the terminating gateway will be encrypted using one-way TLS authentication. If a path to a
[client certificate](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/terminating-gateway#certfile)
and [private key](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/terminating-gateway#keyfile) are also specified connections
from the terminating gateway will be encrypted using mutual TLS authentication.

~> Setting the `SNI` field is strongly recommended when enabling TLS to a service. If this field is not set,
Consul will not attempt to verify the Subject Alternative Name fields in the service's certificate.

If none of these are provided, Consul will **only** encrypt connections to the gateway and not
from the gateway to the destination service.

## Wildcard service specification

Terminating gateways can optionally target all services within a Consul namespace by specifying a wildcard "\*"
as the service name. Configuration options set on the wildcard act as defaults that can be overridden
by options set on a specific service name.

Note that if the wildcard specifier is used, and some services in that namespace have a service mesh sidecar proxy,
traffic from the mesh to those services will be evenly load-balanced between the gateway and their sidecars.

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by [ACLs](/consul/docs/security/acl).

Reading a `terminating-gateway` config entry requires `service:read` on the `Name`
field of the config entry.

Creating, updating, or deleting a `terminating-gateway` config entry requires
`operator:write`.
