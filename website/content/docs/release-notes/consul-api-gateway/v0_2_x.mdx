# Consul API Gateway 0.2.0

## Release Highlights

- **Cross Namespace Reference Policies:**  Reference Policies are security
  mechanism in the Kubernetes Gateway API that allows users to better control
  how traffic is routed between Kubernetes namespaces. With the previous
  releases of Consul API Gateway, users could route requests from the API
  Gateway across various namespaces without providing any sort of explicit
  permissions. While this meant that any service connected to the service mesh
  was reachable, it didn't allow users to set the more granular restrictions or
  permissions that they may expect.

  This version of API Gateway implements Cross Namespace Reference Policies
  and requires them when routes are in a different namespace than the services
  (as specified by the `backendRefs`) they are routing traffic to.

## Supported Software

- Consul 1.11.2+
- HashiCorp Consul Helm chart 0.43.0+
- Kubernetes 1.21+
- Kubectl 1.21+
- Envoy proxy support is determined by the Consul version deployed. Refer to
  [Envoy Integration](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for details.

## Kubernetes Gateway API Specification

Supported version of the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) spec: `v1alpha2`(v0.4.1)

## Upgrading

~> **Note**: If your current deployment has routes and and services that cross namespaces, those routes will not be applied to their gateways until cross namespace reference policies are created for them.

For detailed information on upgrading, including how to create the required reference policies, please refer to the [upgrade details page](/consul/docs/api-gateway/upgrades)
