# Consul API Gateway 0.5.0

We are pleased to announce the following updates to Consul API Gateway. 

## Release highlights

- **Consul Dataplane Support:** Consul 1.14 introduces a simplified deployment architecture that eliminates the need to deploy node-level Consul clients on Kubernetes. This is referred to as Consul Dataplane. API Gateway 0.5.0 supports this type of deployment.

- **Routing to Services in Peered Clusters:** API Gateway now supports the ability to route traffic to services that are imported from peered Consul clusters. Cluster peering is was added in Consul 1.14. Refer to the `MeshService` [documentation](/consul/docs/api-gateway/configuration/meshservice) for additional information.

- **Deploy in Admin Partitions:** API Gateway can now be deployed in any Consul admin partition. Previous versions of API Gateway could only be deployed in the default partition. The partition is configured in the `GatewayClassConfig`.

- **Configure Maximum Incoming Connections:** You can now configure the number of concurrent incoming connections that Envoy will allow. This is configured by setting the value of the `maxConnection` parameter in the `GatewayClassConfig`.

- **Distroless Envoy Containers:** API Gateway now uses the `envoy-distroless` container image of the Envoy proxy. This improves the security of a gateway by reducing the attack surface of Envoy. Consul Helm chart `1.0.0` or greater is required to use the distroless container image.

- **Support for Kubernetes Tolerations:** You can now configure toleration settings for the Consul API Gateway controller and Gateway instances made with the managed gateway class directly from the [Helm chart](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#h-apigateway). Kubernetes toleration settings allow you to control which nodes in a K8s cluster that the API Gateway pods should be deployed on. Refer to  [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) in the Kubernetes documentation for more information.
