# Consul API Gateway 0.3.0

## Release Highlights

- **Improved High Availability and Scalability via Multiple Instances per Gateway:**
  This release introduces support for deploying multiple instances of a logical
  gateway (i.e. a K8s `gateway` config object). You can use an external load
  balancing service to distribute incoming traffic across the instances of a
  gateway. This provides higher availability of gateway services and also allows
  a single logical gateway to handle a volume of network traffic that is much
  greater than what a single instance of a gateway can.

  Administrators can set the number of instances independently for each logical
  gateway. Administrators can also set, in the `gatewayClassConfig`, the
  minimum, maximum and default number of gateway instances. These are applied
  per `gateway` to all `gateways` in that `gatewayClass`. The minimum and
  maximum settings will override settings configured on any given `gateway`.

  ~> **Note:** There is a hard limit of eight (8) instances per `gateway` and it can
  not be overridden. This hard limit will probably be increased in the future.

- **Cross Namespace Reference Policies for Certificates:**
  Reference policies is a security feature introduced in the 0.2 release. In
  this release, Reference Policies are now required for TLS certificates when a
  `listener` has a `certificateRef` that is in a different `namespace`.
