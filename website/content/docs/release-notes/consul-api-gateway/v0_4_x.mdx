# Consul API Gateway 0.4.0

## Release Highlights

- **Support for Kubernetes Gateway API Version 0.5.0 and v1beta1 APIs:**
  The `v0.5.0` release of the Kubernetes Gateway API is significant because it
  marks the growth in maturity to a beta API version (v1beta1) release for some
  of the key APIs:
  - GatewayClass
  - Gateway
  - HTTPRoute

  The other APIs (e.g. TCPRoute) are still at the `v1alpha2` stage.

  Reaching `v1beta1` status has several benefits for users, including greater
  stability and backward compatibility requirements. Existing fields and allowed
  options can not be removed or renamed except in a new, major version of the
  API. Once an API reaches `v1beta1` status, future versions must comply with
  several backward compatibility requirements.

- **URL Path Prefix Rewrite** This release introduces support for rewriting a
  URL's path prefix when routing HTTP traffic. To use this functionality, add a
  `URLRewrite` filter to an `HTTPRoute` configuration. This enables the gateway
  to rewrite the URL path in a client's HTTP request before sending the request
  to a service. For example, you could configure the gateway to change the path
  from `//store/checkout` to `//cart/checkout`. Refer to the [usage
  documentation](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/usage) for additional information.  

## What has Changed

- **Reference Policy Renamed to Reference Grant** In v0.5.0 of the Kubernetes
  Gateway API, `ReferencePolicy` has been renamed to `ReferenceGrant`. This
  release supports both but `ReferencePolicy` is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version of the standard.

  After upgrading to this version of Consul API Gateway, you should rename all
  existing `ReferencePolicy` to `ReferenceGrant`. Refer to the [Upgrades](/consul/docs/api-gateway/upgrades)
  instructions for additional details.
