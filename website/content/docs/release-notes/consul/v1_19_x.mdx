# Consul 1.19.0

We are pleased to announce the following Consul updates.

## Release highlights

- **External Services CRD**: You can now configure and register external services, including their health checks, alongside existing Kubernetes application manifests with the new [`Registration` Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/registration). This CRD changes the workflow to register a service running on an external node with the Consul catalog. A terminating gateway is still required to enable downstream services in the service mesh to communicate with external services. Refer to [Register external services on Kubernetes overview](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/external-service) for more information.

- **Transparent Proxy on Nomad**: Consul’s CNI plugin enables the use of transparent proxy for seamlessly redirecting traffic through the Envoy proxy without requiring application changes, or elevated network privileges for the workload. As a result, you can onboard applications without additional configuration between a service and its upstreams.

- **API Gateway metrics**: The Consul API Gateway now provides a Prometheus metrics endpoint you can use to gather information about the health of the gateway, as well as traffic for proxied connections or requests.

- **File system certificate configuration entry**: A new [`file-system-certificate` configuration entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/file-system-certificate) supports specifying a filepath to the certificate and private key for Consul API Gateway on VMs on the local system. Previously, the certificate and private key were specified directly in the `inline-certificate` configuration entry. When using the file system certificates, the Consul server never sees the contents of these files. 

  File system certificates also include a file system watch that allows for changing the certificate and key without restarting the gateway. This feature requires that you have access to the gateway’s file system in order to place the certificate or update it.

  Consul on Kubernetes deployments that use `consul-k8s` Helm chart v1.5.0 or later use file system certificates without additional configuration. For more information, refer to [File system certificate configuration reference](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/file-system-certificate).

## What's deprecated

- **Snapshot Agent (Enterprise):** Starting with this release, top level single snapshot destinations `local_storage`, `aws_storage`, `azure_blob_storage`, and `google_storage` in snapshot agent configuration files are deprecated. Use the [`backup_destinations`](/consul/commands/snapshot/agent#config-file) config object instead.
