# Consul 1.19.0

We are pleased to announce the following Consul updates.

## Release highlights

- **Argo Rollouts**: subset level splitting
- **External Services CRD**: Define external services with a new `Registration` CRD instead of terminating gateways
- **Transparent Proxy on Nomad**: Consul CNI plugin so no longer need to define upstreams in job spec
- **API Gateway metrics**: API Gateway exposes prometheus metrics in a consistent form. 
- **File system certificate configuration entry**: New configuration entry replaces `inline-certificate` configuration entry for securing Consul API Gateway on VMs

## What's deprecated

- **Snapshot Agent (Enterprise):** Starting with this release, top level single snapshot destinations `local_storage`, `aws_storage`, `azure_blob_storage`, and `google_storage` in snapshot agent configuration files are deprecated. Use the [`backup_destinations`](/consul/commands/snapshot/agent#config-file) config object instead.
