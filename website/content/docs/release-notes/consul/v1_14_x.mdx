# Consul 1.14.0

## Release Highlights

- **Cluster Peering (GA)**: This version promotes Cluster Peering, which is a new model to federate Consul clusters for both service mesh and traditional service discovery, to General Availability. Cluster peering allows for service interconnectivity with looser coupling than the existing WAN federation. For more information, refer to the [cluster peering](/docs/connect/cluster-peering) documentation. Some notable improvements to Cluster Peering include: 
 
  - **Cluster Peering Failover**: 
  
  - **Control Plane traffic over Mesh Gateways**: 

- **Enables TLS on the Envoy Prometheus endpoint**: The Envoy prometheus endpoint can be enabled when `envoy_prometheus_bind_addr` is set and then secured over TLS using new CLI flags for the `consul connect envoy` command. These commands are: `-prometheus-ca-file`, `-prometheus-ca-path`, `-prometheus-cert-file` and `-prometheus-key-file`. The CA, cert, and key can be provided to Envoy by a Kubernetes mounted volume so that Envoy can watch the files and dynamically reload the certs when the volume is updated.

## What's Changed

- Removes support for Envoy 1.19.x and adds support for Envoy 1.23. Refer to the [Envoy Compatibility matrix](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for more details.

- The [`disable_compat_19`](/docs/agent/config/config-files#telemetry-disable_compat_1.9) telemetry configuration option is now removed. In Consul versions 1.10.x through 1.11.x, the config defaulted to `false`. In version 1.12.x it defaulted to `true`. Before upgrading you should remove this flag from your config if the flag is being used.

## Upgrading

For more detailed information, please refer to the [upgrade details page](/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-14-0) and the changelogs.

## Known Issues
The following issues are know to exist in the 1.14.0 release:

- Consul 1.13.1 fixes a compatibility issue when restoring snapshots from pre-1.13.0 versions of Consul. Refer to GitHub issue [[GH-14149](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14149)] for more details.
- Consul 1.13.0 and Consul 1.13.1 default to requiring TLS for gRPC communication with Envoy proxies when auto-encrypt and auto-config are enabled. In environments where Envoy proxies are not already configured to use TLS for gRPC, upgrading Consul 1.13 will cause Envoy proxies to disconnect from the control plane (Consul agents). A future patch release will default to disabling TLS by default for GRPC communication with Envoy proxies when using Service Mesh and auto-config or auto-encrypt. Refer to GitHub issue [[GH-14253](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14253)] and [Service Mesh deployments using auto-config and auto-encrypt](https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#service-mesh-deployments-using-auto-encrypt-or-auto-config) for more details.
