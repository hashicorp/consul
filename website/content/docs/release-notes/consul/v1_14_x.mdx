# Consul 1.14.0

## Release Highlights

- **Cluster Peering (GA)**: This version promotes Cluster Peering, which is a new model to federate Consul clusters for both service mesh and traditional service discovery, to General Availability. Cluster peering allows for service interconnectivity with looser coupling than the existing WAN federation. For more information, refer to the [cluster peering](/docs/connect/cluster-peering) documentation. Some notable improvements to Cluster Peering include: 
 
  - **Cluster Peering Failover**: Cluster Peering now supports the ability to redirect to services running on cluster peers with service resolvers. 
  
  - **Control Plane traffic over Mesh Gateways**: Cluster Peering now supports the ability to allow for Peering establishment to occur using Mesh Gateways.

## What's Changed

- 1.14 adds a new `ports.grpc_tls` configuration option. This introduces a new port to better separate TLS config from the existing `ports.grpc` config. The new `ports.grpc_tls` only supports TLS encrypted communication. The existing `ports.grpc` now only supports plain-text communication. [[GH-15339](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15339)]
- `peering` and `connect` are  default. [[GH-15302](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15302)]
- The gRPC TLS port default value to 8503 [[GH-15302](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15302)]
- Removes support for Envoy 1.20 [[GH-15093](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15093)]
- Rename `PeerName` to `Peer` on prepared queries and exported services. [[GH-14854](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14854)]
- Convert service mesh failover to use Envoy's aggregate clusters. This
changes the names of some [Envoy dynamic HTTP metrics](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#dynamic-http-statistics). [[GH-14178](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14178)]

## Upgrading

For more detailed information, please refer to the [upgrade details page](/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-14-0) and the changelogs.

## Known Issues
The following issues are know to exist in the 1.14.0 release:

- Prior to Consul 1.14, cluster peering or Consul connect were disabled by default. A breaking change was made in Consul 1.14 that enabled Cluster Peering and Consul Connect by default. To disable both, set `peering.enabled` and  `connect.enabled` to false. The changes to Consul service mesh in version 1.14 are incompatible with Nomad 1.4.2 and earlier. If you operate Consul service mesh using Nomad 1.4.2 or earlier, do not upgrade to Consul 1.14 until hashicorp/nomad#15266 is fixed.

- For 1.14.0, there is a known issue with consul connect envoy. If the command is configured to use TLS for contacting the HTTP API, it will also incorrectly enable TLS for gRPC. Users should not upgrade to 1.14.0 if they are using plaintext gRPC connections in conjunction with TLS-encrypted HTTP APIs.
