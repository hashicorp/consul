# Consul 1.14.0

## Release Highlights

- **Cluster Peering (GA)**: This version promotes Cluster Peering, which is a new model to federate Consul clusters for both service mesh and traditional service discovery, to General Availability. Cluster peering allows for service interconnectivity with looser coupling than the existing WAN federation. For more information, refer to the [cluster peering](/docs/connect/cluster-peering) documentation. Some notable improvements to Cluster Peering include: 
 
  - **Cluster Peering Failover**: Cluster Peering now supports the ability to redirect to services running on cluster peers with service resolvers. 
  
  - **Control Plane traffic over Mesh Gateways**: Cluster Peering now supports the ability to allow for Peering establishment to occur using Mesh Gateways.

## What's Changed

- 1.4 adds a new `ports.grpc_tls` configuration option. This introduces a new port to better separate TLS config from the existing `ports.grpc` config. The new `ports.grpc_tls` only supports TLS encrypted communication. The existing `ports.grpc` now only supports plain-text communication. [[GH-15339](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15339)]
- `peering` and `connect` are  default. [[GH-15302](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15302)]
- The gRPC TLS port default value to 8503 [[GH-15302](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15302)]
- Removes support for Envoy 1.20 [[GH-15093](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/15093)]
- Rename `PeerName` to `Peer` on prepared queries and exported services. [[GH-14854](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14854)]
- Convert service mesh failover to use Envoy's aggregate clusters. This
changes the names of some [Envoy dynamic HTTP metrics](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#dynamic-http-statistics). [[GH-14178](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14178)]

## Upgrading

For more detailed information, please refer to the [upgrade details page](/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#consul-1-14-0) and the changelogs.

## Known Issues
The following issues are know to exist in the 1.14.0 release:

- Consul 1.13.1 fixes a compatibility issue when restoring snapshots from pre-1.13.0 versions of Consul. Refer to GitHub issue [[GH-14149](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14149)] for more details.
- Consul 1.13.0 and Consul 1.13.1 default to requiring TLS for gRPC communication with Envoy proxies when auto-encrypt and auto-config are enabled. In environments where Envoy proxies are not already configured to use TLS for gRPC, upgrading Consul 1.13 will cause Envoy proxies to disconnect from the control plane (Consul agents). A future patch release will default to disabling TLS by default for GRPC communication with Envoy proxies when using Service Mesh and auto-config or auto-encrypt. Refer to GitHub issue [[GH-14253](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/14253)] and [Service Mesh deployments using auto-config and auto-encrypt](https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific#service-mesh-deployments-using-auto-encrypt-or-auto-config) for more details.
