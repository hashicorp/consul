# Consul 1.13.0

## Release Highlights

* **Cluster Peering (Beta)** This version adds a new model to federate Consul clusters for both service mesh and traditional service discovery. Cluster peering allows for service interconnectivity with looser coupling than the existing WAN federation. For more information refer to the [cluster peering](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/cluster-peering) documentation.

* **Transparent proxying through terminating gateways** This version adds egress traffic control to destinations outside of Consul's catalog, such as APIs on the public internet. Transparent proxies can dial [destinations defined in service-defaults](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/config-entries/service-defaults#destination) and have the traffic routed through terminating gateways. For more information refer to the [terminating gateway](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/gateways/terminating-gateway#terminating-gateway-configuration) documentation.

* **Enables TLS on the Envoy Prometheus endpoint**. The Envoy prometheus endpoint can be secure over TLS (enabled when `envoy_prometheus_bind_addr` is set) via new CLI flags for the `consul connect envoy` command (i.e. `-prometheus-ca-file`, `-prometheus-ca-path`, `-prometheus-cert-file` and `-prometheus-key-file`). The CA/cert/key can be provided to Envoy via a Kubernetes mounted voulume so that Envoy could watch the files to dynamically reload the certs when the volume is updated. 

* **UDP Health Checks**. Adds the ability to register service discovery health checks that periodically send UDP datagrams to the specified IP/hostname and port. See [Checks - UDP + Interval](/docs/discovery/checks#udp-interval). 

## What's Changed

- Removes support for Envoy 1.19.x and adds suport for Envoy 1.23. Please see the Envoy Compatibility [matrix](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for more details.

- The [`disable_compat_19`](/docs/agent/options#telemetry-disable_compat_1.9) telemetry configuration option is now removed. In prior Consul versions (1.10.x through 1.11.x), the config defaulted to `false` and In 1.12.x it defaulted to `true`. Before upgrading you should remove this flag from your config if the flag is being used.
