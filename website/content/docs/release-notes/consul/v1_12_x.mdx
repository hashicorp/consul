# Consul 1.12.0

## Release Highlights

- **AWS IAM Auth Method**: Consul now provides an AWS IAM auth method that allows AWS IAM roles and users to authenticate with Consul to obtain ACL tokens. Refer to [AWS IAM Auth Method](/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods/aws-iam) for detailed configuration information. 

- **Per listener TLS Config**: It is now possible to configure TLS differently for each of Consul's listeners, such as HTTPS, gRPC, and the internal multiplexed RPC listener, using the `tls` stanza. Refer to [TLS Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#tls-configuration-reference) for more details. 

- **AWS Lambda**: Adds the ability to invoke AWS Lambdas through terminating gateways, which allows for cross-datacenter communication, transparent proxy, and intentions with Consul Service Mesh. Refer to [AWS Lambda](/consul/docs/lambda) and [Invoke Lambda Functions](/consul/docs/lambda/invocation) for more details. 

- **Mesh-wide TLS min/max versions and cipher suites**: Using the [Mesh](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/mesh#tls) Config Entry or CRD, it is now possible to set TLS min/max versions and cipher suites for both inbound and outbound mTLS connections.

- **Expanded details for ACL Permission Denied errors**: Details are now provided when a permission denied errors surface for RPC calls. Details include the accessor ID of the ACL token, the missing permission, and any namespace or partition that the error occurred on. 

- **ACL token read**: The `consul acl token read -rules` command now includes an `-expanded` option to display detailed info about any policies and rules affecting the token. Refer to [Consul ACL Token read](/consul/commands/acl/token/read) for more details.

- **Automatically reload agent config when watching agent config file changes**: When using the `auto-reload-config` CLI flag or `auto_reload_config` agent config option, Consul now automatically reloads the [reloadable configuration options](/consul/docs/agent/config#reloadable-configuration) when configuration files change. Refer to [auto_reload_config](/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_auto_reload_config) for more details.


## What's Changed

- Removes support for Envoy 1.17.x and Envoy 1.18.x, and adds support for Envoy 1.21.x and Envoy 1.22.x. Refer to the [Envoy Compatibility matrix](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for more details.  

- The `disable_compat_1.9` option now defaults to true. Metrics formatted in the style of version 1.9, such as `consul.http...`,  can still be enabled by setting disable_compat_1.9 = false. However, these metrics will be removed in 1.13.

- The `agent_master` ACL token has been renamed to `agent_recovery` ACL token. In addition, the `consul acl set-agent-token master` command has been replaced with `consul acl set-agent-token recovery`. Refer to [ACL Agent Recovery Token](/consul/docs/security/acl/acl-tokens#acl-agent-recovery-token) and [Consul ACL Set Agent Token](/consul/commands/acl/set-agent-token) for more information.

- If TLS min versions and max versions are not specified, the TLS min/max versions default to the following values. For details on how to configure TLS min and max, refer to the [Mesh TLS config entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/mesh#tls) or CRD documentation. 
  - Incoming connections: TLS 1.2 for min0 version, TLS 1.3 for max version
  - Outgoing connections: TLS 1.2 for both TLS min and TLS max versions.
