# Consul 1.12.0

## Release Highlights

* **AWS IAM Auth Method:** Added an AWS IAM auth method that allows authenticating to Consul using AWS IAM identities 

* **Per listener TLS Config:** It is now possible to configure TLS differently for each of Consul's listeners (i.e. HTTPS, gRPC and the internal multiplexed RPC listener) using the tls stanza. 

* **AWS Lambda:** Add the ability to invoke AWS Lambdas through terminating gateways which allows for cross-datacenter communication, transparent proxy, and intentions with Consul Service Mesh. Please see [AWS Lambda](/docs]/lambda) and [Invoke Lambda Functions](/docs/lambda/invocation) for more details. 

* **Mesh wide TLS min/max versions and cipher suites:** 

* **Add token information to PermissionDeniedErrors** 

* **Automatically reload agent config when watching agnet config file changes**:  using the auto-reload-config CLI flag or auto_reload_config config option 


## What's Changed

- Removes support for Envoy 1.17.x and Envoy 1.18.x, and adds support for Envoy 1.21.x and Envoy 1.22.x. Please see support to the Envoy Compatibility [matrix](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for more details.  

- The disable_compat_1.9 option now defaults to true. 1.9 style `consul.http...` metrics can still be enabled by setting disable_compat_1.9 = false. However, these metrics will be removed in 1.13.

- The `agent_master` ACL token has been renamed to `agent_recovery` ACL token. In addition, the `consul acl set-agent-token master` command has been replaced with `consul acl set-agent-token recovery`. See [ACL Agent Recovery Token](/docs/security/acl/acl-tokens#acl-agent-recovery-token) and [Consul ACL Set Agent Token](/commands/acl/set-agent-token) for more information.
