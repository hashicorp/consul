# Consul on Kubernetes 0.48.0

## Release Highlights

- **Consul CNI Plugin**: This release introduces the Consul CNI Plugin for Consul on Kubernetes, to allow for configuring traffic redirection rules without escalated container privileges such as `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. Refer to [Enable the Consul CNI Plugin](/docs/k8s/installation/install#enable-the-consul-cni-plugin) for more details. The Consul CNI Plugin is supported for Consul K8s 0.48.0+ and Consul 1.13.1+.

- **Kubernetes 1.24 Support**: Add support for Kubernetes 1.24 where ServiceAccounts no longer have long-term JWT tokens. [[GH-1431](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/1431)]
  
- **MaxInboundConnections in service-defaults CRD**: Add support for MaxInboundConnections on the Service Defaults CRD. [[GH-1437](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/1437)]

- **API Gateway: ACL auth when using WAN Federation**: Configure ACL auth for controller correctly when deployed in secondary datacenter with federation enabled [[GH-1462](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/1462)]

## What has Changed

- **Kubernetes 1.24 Support for multiport applications require Kubernetes secrets**: Users deploying multiple services to the same Pod (multiport) on Kubernetes 1.24+ must also deploy a Kubernetes secret for each ServiceAccount associated with the Consul service. The name of the Secret must match the ServiceAccount name and be of type `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`
Example:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: svc1
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/service-account.name: svc1
  type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: svc2
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/service-account.name: svc2
  type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
  ```

## Supported Software

- Consul 1.11.x, Consul 1.12.x and Consul 1.13.1+
- Kubernetes 1.19-1.24
- Kubectl 1.19+
- Envoy proxy support is determined by the Consul version deployed. Refer to
  [Envoy Integration](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for details.

## Known Issues
