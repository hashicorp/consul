# Consul on Kubernetes 1.3.0

We are pleased to announce the following Consul updates. 

## Release highlights

**Catalog v2:** This release provides the ability to preview Consul's v2 Catalog and Resource API. You must enable this feature.
Catalog v2 supports multi-port application deployments with a single Envoy proxy. Refer to the [v2 Catalog and Resource API](/consul/docs/k8s/multiport) documentation for more information.

  The v1 and v2 catalogs are not cross compatible, and not all Consul features are available within this v2 feature preview.
  - The Consul UI must be disabled. It does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
  - HCP Consul Dedicated does not support multi-port services or the v2 catalog API in this release.
  - The v2 API only supports transparent proxy mode where services that have permissions to connect to each other can use Kube DNS to connect.

  <Note> The v2 Catalog and Resources API is currently in feature preview for Consul on Kubernetes 1.3.0 and should not be used in production environments. </Note>

## Supported software

<Note> Consul 1.15.x and 1.14.x are not supported. Please refer to Supported Consul and Kubernetes versions for more detail on choosing the correct consul-k8s version. </Note>

- Consul 1.17.x.
- Consul Dataplane v1.3.x. Refer to [Envoy and Consul Dataplane](/consul/docs/v1.17.x/connect/proxies/envoy#envoy-and-consul-dataplane) for details about Consul Dataplane versions and the available packaged Envoy version.
- Kubernetes 1.24.x - 1.27.x
- kubectl 1.24.x - 1.27.x
- Helm 3.6+


## What's removed

- **Legacy API Gateway support is removed**: The Consul API Gateway that was previously packaged as `consul-api-gateway`, released separately from Consul K8s, and deprecated in Consul v1.16.x is now removed. This gateway is referred to as the _legacy API Gateway_. As of Consul v1.17.0, you must [install](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/api-gateway/install-k8s) the _native API Gateway_ and configure it using the [`connectInject.apiGateway`](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#apigateway) stanza. 

## Upgrading

For more detailed information, please refer to the [upgrade details page](/consul/docs/upgrading/upgrade-specific) and the changelogs.

## Known Issues

The following issues are known to exist in the v1.3.x releases. Refer to the changelog for more information.

- When using the v2 API with transparent proxy, Kubernetes pods cannot use L7 liveness, readiness, or startup probes.
- v1.3.5 - Service-to-service networking is broken when deployed on OpenShift. OpenShift users are advised to avoid deploying this version of consul-k8s.
    A fix is present in the v1.3.6 release [[GH-4037](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/pull/4037)].
