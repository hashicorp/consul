# Consul on Kubernetes 1.0

## Release Highlights

- ** Simplified Service Mesh Deployments with Consul Dataplane **: Consul client agents are no longer deployed by default, and Consul service mesh no longer uses Consul clients to operate. A new component consul-dataplane is now injected as a sidecar-proxy instead of plain Envoy. consul-dataplane manages the Envoy proxy process and proxies xDS requests from Envoy to Consul servers.istered.
  
- **Consul API Gateway 0.5.0 Support**: Support to run Consul API Gateway without clients and allow Consul API Gateway to directly connect to Consul Servers. 

## What's Changed

-  `client.enabled` now defaults to false. Setting it to true will deploy client agents, however, none of the consul-k8s components will use clients for their operation.
- `global.imageEnvoy` is no longer used for sidecar proxies, as well as mesh, terminating, and ingress gateways.
- `externalServers.grpcPort` default is now 8502 instead of 8503.
- `meshGateway.service.enabled` value is removed. Mesh gateways now will always have a Kubernetes service as this is required to register them as a service with Consul.
- Consul snap-shot agent runs as a sidecar to Consul servers, results in the following changes to Helm values:
  - Move `client.snapshotAgent` values to `server.snapshotAgent`, with the exception of the following values: `client.snaphostAgent.replicas`, `client.snaphostAgent.serviceAccount`
  - Remove `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulSnapshotAgentRole` value. You should now use the `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulServerRole` for access to any Vault secrets.
