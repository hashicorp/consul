# Consul on Kubernetes 1.0

## Release Highlights

- ** Simplified Service Mesh Deployments with Consul Dataplane:** Consul client agents are no longer deployed by default, and Consul service mesh no longer uses Consul clients to operate. A new component `consul-dataplane` is now injected as a sidecar-proxy instead of plain Envoy. `consul-dataplane` manages the Envoy proxy process and proxies xDS requests from Envoy to Consul servers. All service mesh consul-k8s components are configured to talk directly to Consul servers.
  
- **Consul API Gateway 0.5.0 Support:** Support to run Consul API Gateway without clients and allow Consul API Gateway to directly connect to Consul servers. 

## What's Changed

- `client.enabled` now defaults to `false`. Setting it to true will deploy client agents, however, none of the consul-k8s components will use clients for their operation. For Vault on Kubernetes using Consul deployed on Kubernetes as a storage backend, `client.enabled` should be set to `true` prior to upgrading.
- `externalServers.grpcPort` default is now 8502 instead of 8503.
- Consul snapshot agent runs as a sidecar to Consul servers. <EnterpriseAlert inline />
  - `client.snapshotAgent` values are moved to `server.snapshotAgent`, with the exception of the following values: `client.snaphostAgent.replicas`, `client.snaphostAgent.serviceAccount`
  - `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulSnapshotAgentRole` value is now removed. You should now use the `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulServerRole` for access to any Vault secrets. 
-  Support simplified default deployment values to allow for easier quick starts and testing:
    * Set `server.replicas` to `1`. Formerly, this defaulted to `3`. 
    * `connectInject.enabled` now defaults to true. 
    * `dns.enabled` and `dns.enableRedirection` will now default to the value of `connectInject.transparentProxy.defaultEnabled`. Previously, `dns.enabled` defaulted to the value of `global.enabled` and `dns.enableRedirection` defaulted to the value to `false`. 
    * Set `connectInject.replicas` to 1 
    * Set `meshGateway.affinity` to null and `meshGateway.replicas` to 1
    * Set `ingressGateways.defaults.affinity` to null and `ingressGateways.defaults.replicas` to 1 
    * Set `terminatingGateways.defaults.affinity` to null and `terminatingGateways.defaults.replicas` to 1
    * `syncCatalog.consulNamespaces.mirroringK8S` now defaults to `true`. <EnterpriseAlert inline />
    * `connectInject.consulNamespaces.mirroringK8S` now defaults to `true`. <EnterpriseAlert inline />
- `global.imageEnvoy` is now replaced with `global.imageConsulDataplane` for running the sidecar proxy. apiGateway.imageEnvoy` is now available  for configuring the version of Envoy that the API Gateway uses.

## Upgrading

For detailed information on upgrading, please refer to the [Upgrades page](/docs/k8s/upgrade)

## Known Issues

The following issues are known to exist in the v1.0.0 release: 

- Pod Security Standards that are configured for the [Pod Security Admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/25/pod-security-admission-stable/) are currently not supported by Consul K8s. OpenShift 4.11.x enables Pod Security Standards on Kubernetes 1.25 [by default](https://connect.redhat.com/en/blog/important-openshift-changes-pod-security-standards) and is also not supported. Support will be added in a future Consul K8s 1.0.x patch release.
