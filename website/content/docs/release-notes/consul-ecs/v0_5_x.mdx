# Consul ECS 0.5.x

## Release Highlights

- **Audit Logging (Enterprise) :** Consul on ECS now captures authentication events and processes them with the HTTP API. Audit logging provides insight into access and usage patterns. Refer to [Audit Logging](/consul/docs/ecs/enterprise#audit-logging) for usage information.

- **AWS IAM Auth Method :** This feature provides support for Consul's AWS IAM auth method. This allows AWS IAM roles and users to authenticate with Consul to obtain ACL tokens. Refer to [ECS Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/ecs/configuration-reference#consullogin) for configuration information.

- **Mesh Gateways :** This feature introduces support for running mesh gateways as ECS tasks. Mesh gateways enable service mesh communication across datacenter and admin partition boundaries. Refer to [ECS Installation with Terraform](/consul/docs/ecs/terraform/install#configure-the-gateway-task-module) for usage information.
