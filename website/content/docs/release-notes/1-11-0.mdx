# Consul 1.11.0

## Release Highlights

- **Admin Partitions (Enterprise):** Consul 1.11.0 Enteprise introduces a new entity for defining administrative and networking boundaries within a Consul deployment. For more information refer to the [Admin Partitions](/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions) documentation.

- **Virtual IPs for Connect-enabled services**  Consul will now generate a unique virtual IP for each connect-enabled service (this will also differ across namespace/partition in Enterprise)

- **Replace legacy `boltdb` implementation with `etcd/bbolt` for raft log store:** Consul now leverages `etcd/bbolt` as the default implemetation of `boltdb` instead of the legacy version of `boltdb`, which inefficiently used available disk. This change also exposes a configuration to allow for disabling boltdb freelist syncing. In addition, Consul now emits metrics for the raft boltdb store to give us insights into boltdb performance.

- **Vault Auth Method support for Connect CA Vault Provider:** Consul now supports Vault auth methods for the Connect CA Vault provider. Currently, we support any non-deprecated auth methods the latest version of Vault supports (v1.8.5), which include AppRole, AliCloud, AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, GitHub, Google Cloud, JWT/OIDC, Kerberos, Kubernetes, LDAP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Okta, Radius, TLS Certificates, and Username & Password.

## What's Changed
 
- The legacy ACL system that was deprecated in Consul 1.4.0 has been removed. Before upgrading you should verify that nothing is still using the legacy ACL system. See the [Migrate Legacy ACL Tokens Learn Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-token-migration) for more information. 

- The previously named `agent_master` ACL token is now renamed as the `agent_recovery` ACL token. In addition, the `consul acl set-agent-token master` command has been replaced with `consul acl set-agent-token recovery`. See [ACL Agent Recovery Token](https://www.consul.io/docs/security/acl/acl-system#acl-agent-recovery-token) and [Consul ACL Set Agent Token](https://www.consul.io/commands/acl/set-agent-token) for more information. 

- Drops support for Envoy versions 1.15.x and 1.16.x
