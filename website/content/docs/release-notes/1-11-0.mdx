# Consul 1.11.0

## Release Highlights

- **Admin Partitions (Enterprise):** Consul 1.11.0 Enteprise introduces a new entity for defining administrative and networking boundaries within a Consul deployment. For more information refer to the [Admin Partitions](/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions) documentation.

- **Support for xDS v3 and Incremental xDS:** Consul 1.10 will default to using xDS version 3 and Incremental xDS for all supported Envoy proxy versions bootstrapped by the Consul 1.10 CLI. This is driven by the fact that xDS v2 was deprecated in Envoy 1.15 and disabled in Envoy 1.17. Envoy proxies bootstrapped with older Consul CLI binaries will continue to use the xDS v2 state-of-the-world API.

- **Replace boltdb with bbolt for raft log store:** Consul now leverages bbolt instead of bolt for as a raft log store. This also exposes a configuration to allow for disabling boltdb freelist syncing. In addition Consul now emits metrics for the raft boltdb store to give us insights into boltdb performance.

- **Vault Auth Method support for Connect CA Vault Provider:** Support Vault auth methods for the Connect CA Vault provider. Currently, we support any non-deprecated auth methods the latest version of Vault supports (v1.8.5), which include AppRole, AliCloud, AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, GitHub, Google Cloud, JWT/OIDC, Kerberos, Kubernetes, LDAP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Okta, Radius, TLS Certificates, and Username & Password.

## What's Changed
 
- The legacy ACL system that was deprecated in Consul 1.4.0 has been removed. Before upgrading you should verify that nothing is still using the legacy ACL system. See the [Migrate Legacy ACL Tokens Learn Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-token-migration) for more information. 

- The previously named `agent_master` ACL token is now renamed as the `agent_recovery` ACL token. In addition, the `consul acl set-agent-token master` command has been replaced with `consul acl set-agent-token recovery`. See [ACL Agent Recovery Token](https://www.consul.io/docs/security/acl/acl-system#acl-agent-recovery-token) and [Consul ACL Set Agent Token](https://www.consul.io/commands/acl/set-agent-token) for more information. 

- Drops support for Envoy versions 1.15.x and 1.16.x
