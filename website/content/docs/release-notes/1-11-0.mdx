# Consul 1.11.0

## Release Highlights

- **Admin Partitions (Enterprise):** Consul 1.11.0 Enteprise introduces a new entity for defining administrative and networking boundaries within a Consul deployment. This feature also enables servers to communicate with clients over a specific gossip segments created for each partition, and also enables cross partition communication between services across partitions using Mesh Gateways. For more information refer to the [Admin Partitions](/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions) documentation.

- **Virtual IPs for Connect-enabled services**  Consul will now generate a unique virtual IP for each connect-enabled service, allowing transparent proxy to route to services within a data center that exist in different clusters or outside the service mesh.

- **Replace [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) with [etcd-io/bbolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) for raft log store:** Consul now leverages `etcd-io/bbolt` as the default implementation of `boltdb` instead of `boltdb/bolt`. This change also exposes a configuration to allow for disabling boltdb freelist syncing. In addition, Consul now emits metrics for the raft boltdb store to provide insights into boltdb performance.

- **Vault Auth Method support for Connect CA Vault Provider:** Consul now supports configuring the Connect CA Vault provider to use auth methods for authentication to Vault. Consul supports using any non-deprecated auth method that is available in Vault v1.8.5, including AppRole, AliCloud, AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, GitHub, Google Cloud, JWT/OIDC, Kerberos, Kubernetes, LDAP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Okta, Radius, TLS Certificates, and Username & Password.

## What's Changed
 
- The legacy ACL system that was deprecated in Consul 1.4.0 has been removed. Before upgrading you should verify that all tokens and policies have been migrated to newer ACL system. See the [Migrate Legacy ACL Tokens Learn Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-token-migration) for more information. 

- The `agent_master` ACL token has been renamed to `agent_recovery` ACL token. In addition, the `consul acl set-agent-token master` command has been replaced with `consul acl set-agent-token recovery`. See [ACL Agent Recovery Token](/docs/security/acl/acl-system#acl-agent-recovery-token) and [Consul ACL Set Agent Token](/commands/acl/set-agent-token) for more information. 

- Drops support for Envoy versions 1.15.x and 1.16.x
