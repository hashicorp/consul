# Consul-Terraform-Sync 0.6.0

## Release Highlights

Per-Task Execution Mode with Support for Terraform Cloud Agent <EnterpriseAlert inline />: CTS now allows users to select the Terraform execution mode to be “remote” or “cloud agent” per Task. For more information refer to the [per-task execution mode documentation](/docs/nia/network-drivers/terraform-cloud#remote-workspaces).

HCP Consul support <EnterpriseAlert inline />: CTS now supports interoperability with HCP Consul with license retrieval capabilities that allow users to keep licenses in sync with their HCP Consul or Consul enterprise deployment.

Auto Service-Registration with Consul, and Health API Endpoint: CTS now supports a new configuration block that auto registers CTS as a service within Consul as soon as CTS is instantiated. This eliminates the manual step of registering CTS as a service within the Consul catalog. This service registration also enables health checking on CTS using the newly added [health API endpoint](/docs/nia/api/health#health).

CLI discoverability: CTS now improves discoverability in the CLI. The `consul-terraform-sync` command features opt-in autocompletion for flags, subcommands, and arguments

Health Check API: CTS introduces a new [API endpoint](/docs/nia/api/health#health) that provides operators with the health status of their CTS instances.
