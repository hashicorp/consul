# Consul-Terraform-Sync 0.6.0

## Release Highlights


We have implemented the following features in this release:
 
### Per-task Execution Mode with Support for Terraform Cloud Agent <EnterpriseAlert inline /> 

You can now execute Terraform tasks in `remote` or `cloud agent` mode. For more information, refer to the [per-task execution mode documentation](/docs/nia/network-drivers/terraform-cloud#remote-workspaces).

### HCP Consul Support <EnterpriseAlert inline /> 

CTS now supports interoperability with HCP Consul. CTS retrieves licenses from HCP Consul so that users can keep their HCP Consul license or Consul enterprise deployment license in sync.

### Auto Service-registration with Consul and Health API Endpoint 

CTS includes a new configuration block that automatically registers CTS as a service within Consul as soon as CTS is instantiated. This eliminates the manual step of registering CTS as a service within the Consul catalog. This service registration also enables health checking on CTS using the newly added [health API endpoint](/docs/nia/api/health#health).

### CLI Discoverability 

We improved CTS's CLI discoverability functionality. The `consul-terraform-sync` command features opt-in [autocompletion](/docs/nia/cli#autocompletion) for flags, subcommands, and arguments

### Health Check API 

CTS includes a new [API endpoint](/docs/nia/api/health#health) that provides operators with the health status of their CTS instance.
