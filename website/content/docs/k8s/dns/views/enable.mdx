# Enable Consul DNS proxy for Kubernetes

This page describes the process to deploy a Consul DNS proxy in a Kubernetes Pod so that Services can resolve Consul DNS requests. For more information, refer to [Consul DNS views for Kubernetes](/consul/docs/k8s/dns/views).

## Prerequisites

You must meet the following minimum application versions to enable the Consul DNS proxy for Kubernetes:

- Consul v1.20.0 or higher
- Either Consul on Kubernetes or the Consul Helm chart, v1.6.0 or higher

## Update Helm values

To enable the Consul DNS proxy, add the required [Helm values](/consul/docs/k8s/helm) to your Consul on Kubernetes deployment.

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true
dns:
  enabled: true
  proxy: true
```

### ACLs

We recommend you create a dedicated [ACL token with DNS permissions](/consul/docs/security/acl/tokens/create/create-a-dns-token) for the Consul DNS proxy. The Consul DNS proxy requires these ACL permissions.

```hcl
node_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}

service_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}
```

You can manage ACL tokens with Consul on Kubernetes, or you can configure the DNS proxy to access a token stored in Kubernetes secret. To use a Kubernetes secret, add the following configuration to your Helm chart.

```yaml
dns:
  proxy:
    aclToken:
      secretName: <Consul-DNS-Token>
      secretKey: <Token-Value>
```

## Retrieve Consul DNS proxy's address

To look up the IP address for the Consul DNS proxy in the Kubernetes Pod, run the following command.

```shell-session
$ kubectl get services â€“-all-namespaces --selector="app=consul,component=dns-proxy" --output jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'  
10.96.148.46  
```

Use this address when you update the ConfigMap resource.

## Update Kubernetes ConfigMap

Create or update a [ConfigMap object in the Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) so that Kubernetes forwards DNS requests with the `.consul` domain to the IP address of the Consul DNS proxy.

The following example of a `coredns-custom` ConfigMap configures Kubernetes to forward Consul DNS requests in the cluster to the Consul DNS Proxy running on `10.96.148.46`. This resource modifies the CoreDNS without modifications to the original `Corefile`.

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap  
metadata:  
  name: coredns-custom  
  namespace: kube-system  
data:  
  consul.server: |  
    consul:53 {  
      errors  
      cache 30  
      forward . 10.96.148.46
      reload  
    }  
```

After updating the DNS configuration, perform a rolling restart of the CoreDNS.

```shell-session
kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns
```

For more information about using a `coredns-custom` resource, refer to the [Rewrite DNS guide in the Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/coredns-custom#rewrite-dns). For general information about modifying a ConfigMap, refer to [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#coredns).

## Next steps

After you enable the Consul DNS proxy, services in the Kubernetes cluster can resolve Consul DNS addresses.

- To learn more about Consul DNS for service discovery, refer to [DNS usage overview](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-overview).
- If your datacenter has ACLs enabled, create a [Consul ACL token](/consul/docs/security/acl/tokens) for the Consul DNS proxy and then restart the DNS proxy.
- To enable service discovery across admin partitions, [export services between partitions](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/exported-services).
- To use Consul DNS for service discovery with other runtimes, across cloud regions, or between cloud providers, [establish a cluster peering connection](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/establish-peering).
