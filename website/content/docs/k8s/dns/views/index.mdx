# Consul DNS views for Kubernetes

This topic describes how to schedule a dedicated Consul DNS proxy in a Kubernetes Pod so that Kubernetes Services can use Consul DNS addresses. 

## Introduction

Kubernetes operators typically choose networking tools such as [kube-dns](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/) or [CoreDNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns/) for their service discovery operations, and choose to bypass Consul DNS entirely. These options may be sufficient for service networking operations within a single Kubernetes cluster.

Because Consul is interoperabile between runtimes and cloud providers, you can use Consul on Kubernetes to discover services that were registered with any Consul datacenter, even ones running on non-Kubernetes deployments. For example, you can [create a cluster peering connection](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/establish-peering) between a Consul datacenter running on Kubernetes and a Consul datacenter running on a virtual machine. Then, you can run the Consul DNS proxy as a Kubernetes Service so that other Services can use Consul DNS to resolve the services running on the VM.

To use Consul DNS for service discovery on Kubernetes, deploy a `consul-proxy` service in each Kubernetes Pod that needs to resolve Consul DNS. All DNS requests in the Kubernetes Pod are sent to the Kubernetes controller first. The controller forwards requests for the `.consul` domain to the `consul-proxy` service, which then queries the Consul catalog and returns service discovery results.

The `consul-proxy` does not require the presence of Consul client agents or Consul dataplanes. As a result, it removes gossip communication as a requirement for Consul DNS.

## Workflows

The process to enable Consul DNS views for service discovery in Kubernetes deployments consists of the following steps:

1. Update the Helm chart for your Consul on Kubernetes deployment so that `dns.proxy.enabled=true`. When you apply the update, Kubernetes deploys the Consul DNS proxy.
1. Look up the IP address for the Consul DNS proxy in the Kubernetes Pod.
1. Update the DNS configuration in the Kubernetes cluster to forward requests for the `.consul` domain to the IP address of the Consul DNS proxy.

For more information about the underlying concepts, refer to [DNS forwarding overview](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-forwarding).

## Benefits

Consul on Kubernetes currently uses [Consul dataplanes](/consul/docs/connect/dataplane) by default. These lightweight processes provide Consul access to the sidecar proxies in the service mesh, but leave Kubernetes in charge of most other service discovery and service mesh operations.

- **Use KubeDNS and Consul DNS in a single deployment**.  The Consul DNS proxy enables any Service in a Pod to resolve an address through Consul DNS without changes to the underlying Kubernetes DNS functionality.
- **Consul service discovery using less resources**. When you use the Consul DNS proxy for service discovery, you do not need to schedule Consul client agents or dataplanes. One Kubernetes Service that uses the same resources as a single Consul dataplane provides the entire Pod access to the Consul catalog.
- **Consul DNS without gossip communication**. The Consul DNS service runs on both Consul server and Consul client agents, which use [gossip communication](/consul/docs/security/encryption/gossip) to ensure that service discovery results are up-to-date. The Consul DNS proxy provides access to Consul DNS without the security overhead of agent-to-agent gossip.

## Scaling techniques

By default, Consul forwards all DNS requests to the current leader in the Consul server cluster. When operating at scale, this configuration may result in longer response times because a single server must respond to every DNS query. There are several strategies for distributing this burden in your datacenter:

- [Allow Stale Reads](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-cache#stale-reads). Allows other servers besides the leader to answer the query rather than forwarding it to the leader.
- [Configure DNS TTLs](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-cache#ttl-values). Configure a TTL to nodes or services that the DNS subsystem on the service containerâ€™s OS uses. Services then resolve DNS queries locally without any external requests.  
- [Add Read Replicas](/consul/docs/enterprise/read-scale). Enterprise users can use read replicas, which are additional Consul servers that replicate cluster data without participating in the Raft quorum.
- [Use Cache to prevent server requests](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#dns_use_cache). Configure the Consul client to use its agent cache to subscribe to events about a service or node. After you establish the watch, the local Consul client agent can resolve DNS queries about the service or node without querying Consul servers.

The following table describes the availability of each scaling technique depending on whether you configure Consul to offload DNS requests from the cluster leader to a client agent, dataplane, or DNS proxy.

| Scaling technique                   | Supported by Consul DNS Proxy |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------: |
| Configure DNS TTLs                  | &#9989;                       |
| Allow Stale Reads                   | &#9989;                       |
| Add Read Replicas                   | &#9989;                       |
| Use Cache to prevent server request | &#10060;                      |

- You cannot schedule the Consul DNS proxy in other container-based environments. You must use Kubernetes.
