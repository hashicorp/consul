# Storing the ACL Partition Token in Vault

This topic describes how to configure the Consul Helm chart to use an ACL partition token stored in Vault when using [Admin Partitions](/consul/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions) in Consul Enterprise.

## Overview
Complete the steps outlined in the [Data Integration](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault/data-integration) section to use an ACL partition token stored in Vault.

Complete the following steps once:
  1. Store the secret in Vault.
  1. Create a Vault policy that authorizes the desired level of access to the secret.

Repeat the following steps for each datacenter in the cluster:
  1. Create Vault Kubernetes auth roles that link the policy to each Consul on Kubernetes service account that requires access.
  1. Update the Consul on Kubernetes helm chart.

## Prerequisites
Prior to setting up the data integration between Vault and Consul on Kubernetes, you will need to have:
1. Read and completed the steps in the [Systems Integration](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault/systems-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault).
2. Read the [Data Integration Overview](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault/data-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault).

## Store the Secret in Vault

First, generate and store the ACL partition token in Vault. You will only need to perform this action once:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put secret/consul/partition-token token="$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
```

## Create Vault policy

Next, you will need to create a policy that allows read access to this secret.

The path to the secret referenced in the `path` resource is the same value that you will configure in the  `global.acls.partitionToken.secretName` Helm configuration (refer to [Update Consul on Kubernetes Helm chart](#update-consul-on-kubernetes-helm-chart)).

<CodeBlockConfig filename="partition-token-policy.hcl">

```HCL
path "secret/data/consul/partition-token" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Apply the Vault policy by issuing the `vault policy write` CLI command:

```shell-session
$ vault policy write partition-token-policy partition-token-policy.hcl
```

## Create Vault Authorization Roles for Consul

Next, you will create Kubernetes auth roles for the Consul `server-acl-init` job:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/consul-partition-init \
    bound_service_account_names=<Consul server service account> \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=<Consul installation namespace> \
    policies=partition-token-policy \
    ttl=1h
```

To find out the service account name of the `partition-init` job,
you can run the following `helm template` command with your Consul on Kubernetes values file:

```shell-session
$ helm template --release-name ${RELEASE_NAME} -s templates/partition-init-serviceaccount.yaml hashicorp/consul -f values.yaml
```

## Update Consul on Kubernetes Helm chart

Now that you have configured Vault, you can configure the Consul Helm chart to
use the  ACL partition token key in Vault and the service account for the Partitions role.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  secretsBackend:
    vault:
      enabled: true
      manageSystemACLsRole: consul-server-acl-init
      adminPartitionsRole: consul-partition-init
  acls:
    partitionToken:
      secretName: secret/data/consul/partition-token
      secretKey: token
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Note that `global.acls.partitionToken.secretName` is the path of the secret in Vault.
This should be the same path as the one you included in your Vault policy.
`global.acls.partitionToken.secretKey` is the key inside the secret data. This should be the same
as the key you passed when creating the  ACL partition token secret in Vault.
