# Update the Consul K8s CLI 

Consul K8s CLI is a tool for quickly installing and interacting with Consul on Kubernetes. Ensure that you are running  the correct version of the CLI prior to upgrading your Consul on Kubernetes deployment, as the CLI and the control plane are version dependent. 

## Upgrade the CLI

These instructions describe how to upgrade the current installed version of the CLI to the latest version. If you are looking to upgrade to a specific version, please follow [Install a specific version of the CLI](/consul/docs/k8s/installation/install-cli#install-a-specific-version-of-the-cli).
