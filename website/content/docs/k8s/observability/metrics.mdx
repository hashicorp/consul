# Metrics

Consul on Kubernetes integrates with Prometheus to provide metrics for Consul Service Mesh components, including: service metrics, sidecar proxy metrics, Consul agent (server and client) metrics, and gateway metrics. Service metrics can also be seen in the Consul UI Topology Visualization view. This section documents how to enable them.

## Connect Service and Sidecar Metrics with Metrics Merging

## Consul Agent Metrics

Metrics from the Server Pods and Client Pods can be scraped via Prometheus by setting the field `global.metrics.enableAgentMetrics` to `true`. Additionally, one can configure the metrics retention time on the agents by configuring
the field `global.metrics.agentMetricsRetentionTime` which expects a duration and defaults to `"1m"`. As the Prometheus deployment currently does not support scraping TLS endpoints, agent metrics are currently *unsupported* when TLS is enabled.

```yaml
global:
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    enableAgentMetrics: true
    agentMetricsRetentionTime: "1m"
```
