  Consul supports managing configuration entries via Kubernetes Custom Resources.
  These custom resource can be used to manage the configuration for workloads
  deployed within the cluster.
---

# Custom Resource Definitions

-> This feature requires consul-helm >= 0.26.0, consul-k8s >= 0.20.0 and consul >= 1.8.4.

We support managing Consul [configuration entries](/docs/agent/config-entries)
via Kubernetes Custom Resources. Configuration entries are used to provide
cluster-wide defaults for the service mesh.

We currently support the follow configuration entry kinds:

- [`proxy-defaults`](/docs/agent/config-entries/proxy-defaults)
- [`service-defaults`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults)
- [`service-splitter`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-splitter)
- [`service-router`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-router)
- [`service-resolver`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-resolver)
- [`service-intentions`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-intentions) (requires Consul >= 1.9.0)

The following kinds are **not** currently supported:

- [`ingress-gateway`](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway)
- [`terminating-gateway`](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway)

## Installation

Ensure you have version `0.26.0` of the helm chart:

```shell-session
$ helm search repo hashicorp/consul
NAME            	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/consul	0.26.0       	1.8.5      	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
```

If you don't have `0.26.0`, you will need to update your helm repository cache:

```shell-session
$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "hashicorp" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

Next, you must configure consul-helm via your `values.yaml` to install the custom resource definitions
and enable the controller that acts on them:

```yaml
global:
  name: consul
  image: 'consul:1.9.0' # consul >= 1.8.4 must be used
  imageK8S: 'hashicorp/consul-k8s:0.20.0'

controller:
  enabled: true

connectInject:
  enabled: true
```

Note that:

1. `controller.enabled: true` installs the CRDs and enables the controller.
1. `global.image` must be a Consul version `>= 1.8.4`, e.g. `consul:1.8.4` or `consul:1.9.0`.
1. `global.imageK8S` must be `>= 0.20.0`
1. Configuration entries are used to configure Consul service mesh so it's also
   expected that `connectInject` will be enabled.

See [Install with Helm Chart](/docs/k8s/installation/install) for further installation
instructions.

## Upgrading An Existing Cluster to CRDs

If you have an existing Consul cluster running on Kubernetes you may need to perform
extra steps to migrate to CRDs. See [Upgrade An Existing Cluster to CRDs](/docs/k8s/crds/upgrade-to-crds) for full instructions.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use `kubectl` to create and manage Consul's configuration entries.

### Create

You can create configuration entries via `kubectl apply`.

```shell-session
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  protocol: "http"
EOF

servicedefaults.consul.hashicorp.com/foo created
```

See [Specifications](#specifications) for detailed schema documentation.

### Get

You can use `kubectl get [kind] [name]` to get the status of the configuration entry:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get servicedefaults foo
NAME  SYNCED
foo   True
```

The `SYNCED` status shows whether the configuration entry was successfully created
in Consul.

### Describe

You can use `kubectl describe [kind] [name]` to investigate the status of the
configuration entry. If `SYNCED` is false, the status will contain the reason
why.

```shell-session
$ kubectl describe servicedefaults foo
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2020-10-09T21:15:50Z
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Synced
```

### Edit

You can use `kubectl edit [kind] [name]` to edit the configuration entry:

```shell
$ kubectl edit servicedefaults foo
# change protocol: http => protocol: tcp
servicedefaults.consul.hashicorp.com/foo edited
```

You can then use `kubectl get` to ensure the change was synced to Consul:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get servicedefaults foo
NAME  SYNCED
foo   True
```

### Delete

You can use `kubectl delete [kind] [name]` to delete the configuration entry:

```shell-session
$ kubectl delete servicedefaults foo
servicedefaults.consul.hashicorp.com "foo" deleted
```

You can then use `kubectl get` to ensure the configuration entry was deleted:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get servicedefaults foo
Error from server (NotFound): servicedefaults.consul.hashicorp.com "foo" not found
```

#### Delete Hanging

If running `kubectl delete` hangs without exiting, there may be
a dependent configuration entry registered with Consul that prevents the target configuration entry from being
deleted. For example, if you set the protocol of your service to `http` via `ServiceDefaults` and then
create a `ServiceSplitter`, you won't be able to delete the `ServiceDefaults`.

This is because by deleting the `ServiceDefaults` config, you are setting the
protocol back to the default which is `tcp`. Since `ServiceSplitter` requires
that the service has an `http` protocol, Consul will not allow the `ServiceDefaults`
to be deleted since that would put Consul into a broken state.

In order to delete the `ServiceDefaults` config, you would need to first delete
the `ServiceSplitter`.

## Specifications

### ProxyDefaults

A [proxy-defaults](/docs/agent/config-entries/proxy-defaults)
entry configures global defaults across all proxies.

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ProxyDefaults
metadata:
  name: global
spec:
  config:
    envoy_tracing_json: '{"http":{"config":{"collector_cluster":"jaeger_9411","collector_endpoint":"/api/v2/spans"},"name":"envoy.zipkin"}}'
  expose:
    checks: true
    paths:
      - listenerPort: 80
        localPathPort: 42
        path: /test/path
        protocol: http
      - listenerPort: 8080
        localPathPort: 4201
        path: /root/test/path
        protocol: http2
  meshGateway:
    mode: local
```

Notes:

1. There can only be one `ProxyDefaults` resource and its name **must** be `global`.
1. Keys under `spec.config` will need to use `snake_case`, not `camelCase`, because
   this config is passed directly to Envoy which uses `snake_case`, e.g.
   ```yaml
   spec:
     config:
       envoy_statsd_url: 'udp://127.0.0.1:8125'
   ```
1. See [proxy-defaults](/docs/agent/config-entries/proxy-defaults) for full
   documentation on this config entry.

### ServiceDefaults

A [service-defaults](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults)
entry configures a specific service.

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: your-service-name
spec:
  protocol: https
  meshGateway:
    mode: local
  expose:
    checks: true
    paths:
      - listenerPort: 80
        path: /path
        localPathPort: 9000
        protocol: http
      - listenerPort: 8080
        path: /another-path
        localPathPort: 9091
        protocol: http2
  externalSNI: external-sni
```

Notes:

1. The name of the service that this `ServiceDefaults` configures is set by
   `metadata.name`.
1. See [service-defaults](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults) for full
   documentation on this config entry.

### ServiceIntentions

A [service-intentions](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-intentions)
entry configures traffic authorization for a destination service.

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceIntentions
metadata:
  name: my-intention
spec:
  destination:
    name: your-service-name
  sources:
    - name: svc1
      namespace: test
      action: allow
      permissions: []
      description: allow access from svc1
    - name: '*'
      namespace: not-test
      action: deny
      permissions: []
      description: disallow access from namespace not-test
    - name: svc-2
      namespace: bar
      action: ''
      permissions:
        - action: allow
          http:
            pathExact: /foo
            pathPrefix: /bar
            pathRegex: /baz
            header:
              - name: header
                present: true
                exact: exact
                prefix: prefix
                suffix: suffix
                regex: regex
                invert: true
            methods:
              - GET
              - PUT
      description: an L7 config
```

Notes:

1. This resource is only supported in Consul 1.9.0.
1. **Unlike the other configuration entries**, the value of `metadata.name` does not
   define which service the intention applies to.
   Instead, the name of the service this intention
   is configuring is set in `spec.destination.name`.

   The `metadata.name` field can be set to any value,
   however, we recommend setting it to the name of the destination service the
   intention is configuring.

1. Wildcard intentions can be created by setting `spec.destination.name` to `*` and/or
   `spec.sources[].name` to `*`. For example to create a `deny` intention that applies
   to all services:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
   kind: ServiceIntentions
   metadata:
    name: deny-all
   spec:
    destination:
      name: *
    sources:
      - name: *
        action: deny
   ```

1. See [service-intentions](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-intentions) for full
   documentation on this config entry.

### ServiceResolver

A [service-resolver](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-resolver)
entry configures which service instances should satisfy Connect upstream discovery requests for a given service name.

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceResolver
metadata:
  name: your-service-name
spec:
  defaultSubset: default_subset
  subsets:
    subset1:
      filter: filter1

      maximumRingSize: 2
    leastRequestConfig:
      choiceCount: 1
    hashPolicies:
      - field: field
        fieldValue: value
        cookieConfig:
          session: true
          ttl: 1
          path: path
        sourceIP: true
        terminal: true
```

### ServiceRouter

A [service-router](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-router)
entry configures traffic routing and manipulation at networking layer 7 (e.g. HTTP).

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceRouter
metadata:
  name: your-service-name
spec:
