# Rotating Server Certificates

As of Consul Helm version `0.29.0`, if TLS is enabled, new TLS certificates for the Consul Server
are issued every time the TLS-init job runs. These certificates are signed by the same CA and will
continue to work as expected in the existing cluster.

Consul serves read the certificates during start-up and keep them in-memory. In order to ensure the
servers utilize the newer certificate, the servers pods need to be [restarted safely](/docs/k8s/operations/upgrade#upgrading-consul-servers).

To explicitly perform certificate, perform the following steps:

1. Perform a `helm upgrade`:

   ```shell-session
   helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul -f /path/to/my/values.yaml
   ```

   This should run the `tls-init` job that will generate new Server certificates.

1. Restart the Server pods following the steps [here](/docs/k8s/operations/upgrade#upgrading-consul-servers).
