# FAQ

## Upgrades

- Can I upgrade directly to a specific Helm chart version or should I upgrade one patch release at a time?
  - It is safe to upgrade directly to a specific version. Be sure to read the release notes for all versions you're upgrading
    through and look for any breaking changes.
- Can I upgrade in place or should I spin up a new Kubernetes cluster?

  - It is always safer to spin up a new Kubernetes cluster but that is not an
    option for most teams. Consul supports upgrading in place.

    Non-production environments should be upgraded first. If upgrading
    a Consul version, Consul data should be backed up.
