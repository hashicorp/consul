# Helm Chart Reference

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a reasonable default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Consul.

## All Values

### global ((#h-global))

- `global` ((#v-global)) - Holds values that affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` ((#v-global-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - The main enabled/disabled setting. If true, servers,
    clients, Consul DNS and the Consul UI will be enabled. Each component can override
    this default via its component-specific "enabled" config. If false, no components
    will be installed by default and per-component opt-in is required, such as by
    setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `logLevel` ((#v-global-loglevel)) (`string: info`) - The default log level to apply to all components which do not otherwise override this setting.
    It is recommended to generally not set this below "info" unless actively debugging due to logging verbosity.
    One of "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".

  - `logJSON` ((#v-global-logjson)) (`boolean: false`) - Enable all component logs to be output in JSON format.

  - `name` ((#v-global-name)) (`string: null`) - Set the prefix used for all resources in the Helm chart. If not set,
    the prefix will be `<helm release name>-consul`.

  - `domain` ((#v-global-domain)) (`string: consul`) - The domain Consul will answer DNS queries for
    (Refer to [`-domain`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_domain)) and the domain services synced from
    Consul into Kubernetes will have, e.g. `service-name.service.consul`.

  - `peering` ((#v-global-peering)) - Configures the Cluster Peering feature. Requires Consul v1.14+ and Consul-K8s v1.0.0+.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-peering-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart enables Cluster Peering for the cluster. This option enables peering controllers and
      allows use of the PeeringAcceptor and PeeringDialer CRDs for establishing service mesh peerings.

  - `adminPartitions` ((#v-global-adminpartitions)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Enabling `adminPartitions` allows creation of Admin Partitions in Kubernetes clusters.
    It additionally indicates that you are running Consul Enterprise v1.11+ with a valid Consul Enterprise
    license. Admin partitions enables deploying services across partitions, while sharing
    a set of Consul servers.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-adminpartitions-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will enable Admin Partitions for the cluster. The clients in the server cluster
      must be installed in the default partition. Creation of Admin Partitions is only supported during installation.
      Admin Partitions cannot be installed via a Helm upgrade operation. Only Helm installs are supported.

    - `name` ((#v-global-adminpartitions-name)) (`string: default`) - The name of the Admin Partition. The partition name cannot be modified once the partition has been installed.
      Changing the partition name would require an un-install and a re-install with the updated name.
      Must be "default" in the server cluster ie the Kubernetes cluster that the Consul server pods are deployed onto.

  - `image` ((#v-global-image)) (`string: hashicorp/consul:<latest version>`) - The name (and tag) of the Consul Docker image for clients and servers.
    This can be overridden per component. This should be pinned to a specific
    version tag, otherwise you may inadvertently upgrade your Consul version.

    Examples:

    ```yaml
    # Consul 1.10.0
    image: "consul:1.10.0"
    # Consul Enterprise 1.10.0
    image: "hashicorp/consul-enterprise:1.10.0-ent"
    ```

  - `imagePullSecrets` ((#v-global-imagepullsecrets)) (`array<map>`) - Array of objects containing image pull secret names that will be applied to each service account.
    This can be used to reference image pull secrets if using a custom consul or consul-k8s-control-plane Docker image.
    Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: pull-secret-name
      - name: pull-secret-name-2
    ```

  - `imageK8S` ((#v-global-imagek8s)) (`string: hashicorp/consul-k8s-control-plane:<latest version>`) - The name (and tag) of the consul-k8s-control-plane Docker
    image that is used for functionality such as catalog sync.
    This can be overridden per component.

  - `datacenter` ((#v-global-datacenter)) (`string: dc1`) - The name of the datacenter that the agents should
    register as. This can't be changed once the Consul cluster is up and running
    since Consul doesn't support an automatic way to change this value currently:
    https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1858.

  - `enablePodSecurityPolicies` ((#v-global-enablepodsecuritypolicies)) (`boolean: false`) - Controls whether pod security policies are created for the Consul components
    created by this chart. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/.

  - `secretsBackend` ((#v-global-secretsbackend)) - secretsBackend is used to configure Vault as the secrets backend for the Consul on Kubernetes installation.
    The Vault cluster needs to have the Kubernetes Auth Method, KV2 and PKI secrets engines enabled
    and have necessary secrets, policies and roles created prior to installing Consul.
    Refer to [Vault as the Secrets Backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/vault)
    documentation for full instructions.

    The Vault cluster _must_ not have the Consul cluster installed by this Helm chart as its storage backend
    as that would cause a circular dependency.
    Vault can have Consul as its storage backend as long as that Consul cluster is not running on this Kubernetes cluster
    and is being managed separately from this Helm installation.

    Note: When using Vault KV2 secrets engines the "data" field is implicitly required for Vault API calls,
    secretName should be in the form of  "vault-kv2-mount-path/data/secret-name".
    secretKey should be in the form of "key".

    - `vault` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault))

      - `enabled` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - Enabling the Vault secrets backend will replace Kubernetes secrets with referenced Vault secrets.

      - `consulServerRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-consulserverrole)) (`string: ""`) - The Vault role for the Consul server.
        The role must be connected to the Consul server's service account.
        The role must also have a policy with read capabilities for the following secrets:
        - gossip encryption key defined by the `global.gossipEncryption.secretName` value
        - certificate issue path defined by the `server.serverCert.secretName` value
        - CA certificate defined by the `global.tls.caCert.secretName` value
        - replication token defined by the `global.acls.replicationToken.secretName` value if `global.federation.enabled` is `true`
        To discover the service account name of the Consul server, run
        ```shell-session
        $ helm template --show-only templates/server-serviceaccount.yaml <release-name> hashicorp/consul
        ```
        and check the name of `metadata.name`.

      - `consulClientRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-consulclientrole)) (`string: ""`) - The Vault role for the Consul client.
        The role must be connected to the Consul client's service account.
        The role must also have a policy with read capabilities for the gossip encryption
        key defined by the `global.gossipEncryption.secretName` value.
        To discover the service account name of the Consul client, run
        ```shell-session
        $ helm template --show-only templates/client-serviceaccount.yaml <release-name> hashicorp/consul
        ```
        and check the name of `metadata.name`.

      - `manageSystemACLsRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-managesystemaclsrole)) (`string: ""`) - A Vault role for the Consul `server-acl-init` job, which manages setting ACLs so that clients and components can obtain ACL tokens.
        The role must be connected to the `server-acl-init` job's service account.
        The role must also have a policy with read and write capabilities for the bootstrap, replication or partition tokens
        To discover the service account name of the `server-acl-init` job, run
        ```shell-session
        $ helm template --show-only templates/server-acl-init-serviceaccount.yaml \
          --set global.acls.manageSystemACLs=true <release-name> hashicorp/consul
        ```
        and check the name of `metadata.name`.

      - `adminPartitionsRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-adminpartitionsrole)) (`string: ""`) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> A Vault role that allows the Consul `partition-init` job to read a Vault secret for the partition ACL token.
         The `partition-init` job bootstraps Admin Partitions on Consul servers.
        .
        This role must be bound the `partition-init` job's service account.
        To discover the service account name of the `partition-init` job, run with Helm values for the client cluster:
        ```shell-session
        $ helm template --show-only templates/partition-init-serviceaccount.yaml -f client-cluster-values.yaml <release-name> hashicorp/consul
        ```
        and check the name of `metadata.name`.

      - `controllerRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controllerrole)) (`string: ""`) - The Vault role to read Consul controller's webhook's
        CA and issue a certificate and private key.
        A Vault policy must be created which grants issue capabilities to
        `global.secretsBackend.vault.controller.tlsCert.secretName`.

      - `connectInjectRole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectinjectrole)) (`string: ""`) - The Vault role to read Consul connect-injector webhook's CA
        and issue a certificate and private key.
        A Vault policy must be created which grants issue capabilities to
        `global.secretsBackend.vault.connectInject.tlsCert.secretName`.

      - `consulCARole` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-consulcarole)) (`string: ""`) - The Vault role for all Consul components to read the Consul's server's CA Certificate (unauthenticated).
        The role should be connected to the service accounts of all Consul components, or alternatively `*` since it
        will be used only against the `pki/cert/ca` endpoint which is unauthenticated. A policy must be created which grants
        read capabilities to `global.tls.caCert.secretName`, which is usually `pki/cert/ca`.

      - `agentAnnotations` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-agentannotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
        Vault agent on any pods where it'll be running.
        This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

        ```yaml
        annotations: |
          "sample/annotation1": "foo"
          "sample/annotation2": "bar"
        ```

      - `ca` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-ca)) - Configuration for Vault server CA certificate. This certificate will be mounted
        to any pod where Vault agent needs to run.

        - `secretName` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-ca-secretname)) (`string: ""`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the Vault CA certificate.
          A Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace that Consul is installed into.

        - `secretKey` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-ca-secretkey)) (`string: ""`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the Vault CA certificate.

      - `connectCA` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca)) - Configuration for the Vault Connect CA provider.
        The provider will be configured to use the Vault Kubernetes auth method
        and therefore requires the role provided by `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulServerRole`
        to have permissions to the root and intermediate PKI paths.
        Please refer to [Vault ACL policies](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/ca/vault#vault-acl-policies)
        documentation for information on how to configure the Vault policies.

        - `address` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca-address)) (`string: ""`) - The address of the Vault server.

        - `authMethodPath` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca-authmethodpath)) (`string: kubernetes`) - The mount path of the Kubernetes auth method in Vault.

        - `rootPKIPath` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca-rootpkipath)) (`string: ""`) - The path to a PKI secrets engine for the root certificate.
          For more details, please refer to [Vault Connect CA configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/ca/vault#rootpkipath).

        - `intermediatePKIPath` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca-intermediatepkipath)) (`string: ""`) - The path to a PKI secrets engine for the generated intermediate certificate.
          For more details, please refer to [Vault Connect CA configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/ca/vault#intermediatepkipath).

        - `additionalConfig` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectca-additionalconfig)) (`string: {}`) - Additional Connect CA configuration in JSON format.
          Please refer to [Vault Connect CA configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/ca/vault#configuration)
          for all configuration options available for that provider.

          Example:

          ```yaml
          additionalConfig: |
            {
              "connect": [{
                "ca_config": [{
                     "namespace": "my-vault-ns",
                     "leaf_cert_ttl": "36h"
                  }]
              }]
            }
          ```

      - `controller` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controller))

        - `tlsCert` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controller-tlscert)) - Configuration to the Vault Secret that Kubernetes will use on
          Kubernetes CRD creation, deletion, and update, to get TLS certificates
          used issued from vault to send webhooks to the controller.

          - `secretName` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controller-tlscert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The Vault secret path that issues TLS certificates for controller
            webhooks.

        - `caCert` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controller-cacert)) - Configuration to the Vault Secret that Kubernetes will use on
          Kubernetes CRD creation, deletion, and update, to get CA certificates
          used issued from vault to send webhooks to the controller.

          - `secretName` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-controller-cacert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The Vault secret path that contains the CA certificate for controller
            webhooks.

      - `connectInject` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectinject))

        - `caCert` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectinject-cacert)) - Configuration to the Vault Secret that Kubernetes uses on
          Kubernetes pod creation, deletion, and update, to get CA certificates
          used issued from vault to send webhooks to the ConnectInject.

          - `secretName` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectinject-cacert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The Vault secret path that contains the CA certificate for
            Connect Inject webhooks.

        - `tlsCert` ((#v-global-secretsbackend-vault-connectinject-tlscert)) - Configuration to the Vault Secret that Kubernetes uses on

            inject webhooks.

  - `gossipEncryption` ((#v-global-gossipencryption)) - Configures Consul's gossip encryption key.
    (Refer to [`-encrypt`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_encrypt)).
    By default, gossip encryption is not enabled. The gossip encryption key may be set automatically or manually.
    The recommended method is to automatically generate the key.
    To automatically generate and set a gossip encryption key, set autoGenerate to true.
    Values for secretName and secretKey should not be set if autoGenerate is true.
    To manually generate a gossip encryption key, set secretName and secretKey and use Consul to generate
    a key, saving this as a Kubernetes secret or Vault secret path and key.
    If `global.secretsBackend.vault.enabled=true`, be sure to add the "data" component of the secretName path as required by
    the Vault KV-2 secrets engine [refer to example].

    ```shell-session
    $ kubectl create secret generic consul-gossip-encryption-key --from-literal=key=$(consul keygen)
    ```

    Vault CLI Example:
    ```shell-session
    $ vault kv put consul/secrets/gossip key=$(consul keygen)
    ```
    `gossipEncryption.secretName="consul/data/secrets/gossip"`
    `gossipEncryption.secretKey="key"`

    - `autoGenerate` ((#v-global-gossipencryption-autogenerate)) (`boolean: false`) - Automatically generate a gossip encryption key and save it to a Kubernetes or Vault secret.

    - `secretName` ((#v-global-gossipencryption-secretname)) (`string: ""`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret or Vault secret path that holds the gossip
      encryption key. A Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace that Consul is installed into.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-global-gossipencryption-secretkey)) (`string: ""`) - The key within the Kubernetes secret or Vault secret key that holds the gossip
      encryption key.

  - `recursors` ((#v-global-recursors)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of addresses of upstream DNS servers that are used to recursively resolve DNS queries.
    These values are given as `-recursor` flags to Consul servers and clients.
    Refer to [`-recursor`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_recursor) for more details.
    If this is an empty array (the default), then Consul DNS will only resolve queries for the Consul top level domain (by default `.consul`).

  - `tls` ((#v-global-tls)) - Enables [TLS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/security/tls-encryption-secure)
    across the cluster to verify authenticity of the Consul servers and clients.
    Requires Consul v1.4.1+.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-tls-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will enable TLS for Consul
      servers and clients and all consul-k8s-control-plane components, as well as generate certificate
      authority (optional) and server and client certificates.
      This setting is required for [Cluster Peering](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/k8s).

    - `enableAutoEncrypt` ((#v-global-tls-enableautoencrypt)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, turns on the auto-encrypt feature on clients and servers.
      It also switches consul-k8s-control-plane components to retrieve the CA from the servers
      via the API. Requires Consul 1.7.1+.

    - `serverAdditionalDNSSANs` ((#v-global-tls-serveradditionaldnssans)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of additional DNS names to set as Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
      in the server certificate. This is useful when you need to access the
      Consul server(s) externally, for example, if you're using the UI.

    - `serverAdditionalIPSANs` ((#v-global-tls-serveradditionalipsans)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of additional IP addresses to set as Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
      in the server certificate. This is useful when you need to access the
      Consul server(s) externally, for example, if you're using the UI.

    - `verify` ((#v-global-tls-verify)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, `verify_outgoing`, `verify_server_hostname`,
      and `verify_incoming` for internal RPC communication will be set to `true` for Consul servers and clients.
      Set this to false to incrementally roll out TLS on an existing Consul cluster.
      Please refer to [TLS on existing clusters](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/operations/tls-on-existing-cluster)
      for more details.

    - `httpsOnly` ((#v-global-tls-httpsonly)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, the Helm chart will configure Consul to disable the HTTP port on
      both clients and servers and to only accept HTTPS connections.

    - `caCert` ((#v-global-tls-cacert)) - A secret containing the certificate of the CA to use for TLS communication within the Consul cluster.
      If you have generated the CA yourself with the consul CLI, you could use the following command to create the secret
      in Kubernetes:

      ```shell-session
      $ kubectl create secret generic consul-ca-cert \
          --from-file='tls.crt=./consul-agent-ca.pem'
      ```
      If you are using Vault as a secrets backend with TLS, `caCert.secretName` must be provided and should reference
      the CA path for your PKI secrets engine. This should be of the form `pki/cert/ca` where `pki` is the mount point of your PKI secrets engine.
      A read policy must be created and associated with the CA cert path for `global.tls.caCert.secretName`.
      This will be consumed by the `global.secretsBackend.vault.consulCARole` role by all Consul components.
      When using Vault the secretKey is not used.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-tls-cacert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the CA certificate.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-tls-cacert-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the CA certificate.

    - `caKey` ((#v-global-tls-cakey)) - A Kubernetes or Vault secret containing the private key of the CA to use for
      TLS communication within the Consul cluster. If you have generated the CA yourself
      with the consul CLI, you could use the following command to create the secret
      in Kubernetes:

      ```shell-session
      $ kubectl create secret generic consul-ca-key \
          --from-file='tls.key=./consul-agent-ca-key.pem'
      ```

      Note that we need the CA key so that we can generate server and client certificates.
      It is particularly important for the client certificates since they need to have host IPs
      as Subject Alternative Names. If you are setting server certs yourself via `server.serverCert`
      and you are not enabling clients (or clients are enabled with autoEncrypt) then you do not
      need to provide the CA key.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-tls-cakey-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the CA key.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-tls-cakey-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the CA key.

  - `enableConsulNamespaces` ((#v-global-enableconsulnamespaces)) (`boolean: false`) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> `enableConsulNamespaces` indicates that you are running
    Consul Enterprise v1.7+ with a valid Consul Enterprise license and would
    like to make use of configuration beyond registering everything into
    the `default` Consul namespace. Additional configuration
    options are found in the `consulNamespaces` section of both the catalog sync
    and connect injector.

  - `acls` ((#v-global-acls)) - Configure ACLs.

    - `manageSystemACLs` ((#v-global-acls-managesystemacls)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will automatically manage ACL tokens and policies
      for all Consul and consul-k8s-control-plane components.
      This requires Consul >= 1.4.

    - `bootstrapToken` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken)) - A Kubernetes or Vault secret containing the bootstrap token to use for
      creating policies and tokens for all Consul and consul-k8s-control-plane components.
      If set, we will skip ACL bootstrapping of the servers and will only
      initialize ACLs for the Consul clients and consul-k8s-control-plane system components.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the bootstrap token.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the bootstrap token.

    - `createReplicationToken` ((#v-global-acls-createreplicationtoken)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, an ACL token will be created that can be used in secondary
      datacenters for replication. This should only be set to true in the
      primary datacenter since the replication token must be created from that
      datacenter.
      In secondary datacenters, the secret needs to be imported from the primary
      datacenter and referenced via `global.acls.replicationToken`.

    - `replicationToken` ((#v-global-acls-replicationtoken)) - replicationToken references a secret containing the replication ACL token.
      This token will be used by secondary datacenters to perform ACL replication
      and create ACL tokens and policies.
      This value is ignored if `bootstrapToken` is also set.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-acls-replicationtoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the replication token.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-acls-replicationtoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the replication token.

    - `resources` ((#v-global-acls-resources)) (`map`) - The resource requests (CPU, memory, etc.) for the server-acl-init and server-acl-init-cleanup pods.
      This should be a YAML map corresponding to a Kubernetes
      [`ResourceRequirements``](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/#resourcerequirements-v1-core)
      object.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: '200Mi'
          cpu: '100m'
        limits:
          memory: '200Mi'
          cpu: '100m'
      ```

    - `partitionToken` ((#v-global-acls-partitiontoken)) - partitionToken references a Vault secret containing the ACL token to be used in non-default partitions.
      This value should only be provided in the default partition and only when setting
      the `global.secretsBackend.vault.enabled` value to true.
      Consul will use the value of the secret stored in Vault to create an ACL token in Consul with the value of the
      secret as the secretID for the token.
      In non-default, partitions set this secret as the `bootstrapToken`.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-acls-partitiontoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Vault secret that holds the partition token.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-acls-partitiontoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Vault secret that holds the parition token.

    - `tolerations` ((#v-global-acls-tolerations)) (`string: ""`) - tolerations configures the taints and tolerations for the server-acl-init
      and server-acl-init-cleanup jobs. This should be a multi-line string matching the
      [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) array in a Pod spec.

    - `nodeSelector` ((#v-global-acls-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
      labels for the server-acl-init and server-acl-init-cleanup jobs pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      nodeSelector: |
        beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
      ```

  - `enterpriseLicense` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> This value refers to a Kubernetes or Vault secret that you have created
    that contains your enterprise license. It is required if you are using an
    enterprise binary. Defining it here applies it to your cluster once a leader
    has been elected. If you are not using an enterprise image or if you plan to
    introduce the license key via another route, then set these fields to null.
    Note: the job to apply license runs on both Helm installs and upgrades.

    - `secretName` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the enterprise license.
      A Kubernetes secret must be in the same namespace that Consul is installed into.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes or Vault secret that holds the enterprise license.

    - `enableLicenseAutoload` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense-enablelicenseautoload)) (`boolean: true`) - Manages license autoload. Required in Consul 1.10.0+, 1.9.7+ and 1.8.12+.

  - `federation` ((#v-global-federation)) - Configure federation.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-federation-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If enabled, this datacenter will be federation-capable. Only federation

      Requires `global.tls.enabled`, `meshGateway.enabled` and `connectInject.enabled`
      to be true. Requires Consul 1.8+.

    - `createFederationSecret` ((#v-global-federation-createfederationsecret)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will create a Kubernetes secret that can be imported
      into secondary datacenters so they can federate with this datacenter. The
      secret contains all the information secondary datacenters need to contact
      and authenticate with this datacenter. This should only be set to true
      in your primary datacenter. The secret name is
      `<global.name>-federation` (if setting `global.name`), otherwise
      `<helm-release-name>-consul-federation`.

    - `primaryDatacenter` ((#v-global-federation-primarydatacenter)) (`string: null`) - The name of the primary datacenter.

    - `primaryGateways` ((#v-global-federation-primarygateways)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of addresses of the primary mesh gateways in the form `<ip>:<port>`.
      (e.g. ["1.1.1.1:443", "2.3.4.5:443"]

    - `k8sAuthMethodHost` ((#v-global-federation-k8sauthmethodhost)) (`string: null`) - If you are setting `global.federation.enabled` to true and are in a secondary datacenter,
      set `k8sAuthMethodHost` to the address of the Kubernetes API server of the secondary datacenter.
      This address must be reachable from the Consul servers in the primary datacenter.
      This auth method will be used to provision ACL tokens for Consul components and is different
      from the one used by the Consul Service Mesh.
      Please refer to the [Kubernetes Auth Method documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods/kubernetes).

      You can retrieve this value from your `kubeconfig` by running:

      ```shell-session
      $ kubectl config view \
        -o jsonpath="{.clusters[?(@.name=='<your cluster name>')].cluster.server}"
      ```

  - `metrics` ((#v-global-metrics)) - Configures metrics for Consul service mesh

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-metrics-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - Configures the Helm chart’s components
      to expose Prometheus metrics for the Consul service mesh. By default
      this includes gateway metrics and sidecar metrics.

    - `enableAgentMetrics` ((#v-global-metrics-enableagentmetrics)) (`boolean: false`) - Configures consul agent metrics. Only applicable if
      `global.metrics.enabled` is true.

    - `agentMetricsRetentionTime` ((#v-global-metrics-agentmetricsretentiontime)) (`string: 1m`) - Configures the retention time for metrics in Consul clients and
      servers. This must be greater than 0 for Consul clients and servers
      to expose any metrics at all.
      Only applicable if `global.metrics.enabled` is true.

    - `enableGatewayMetrics` ((#v-global-metrics-enablegatewaymetrics)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, mesh, terminating, and ingress gateways will expose their
      Envoy metrics on port `20200` at the `/metrics` path and all gateway pods
      will have Prometheus scrape annotations. Only applicable if `global.metrics.enabled` is true.

  - `imageConsulDataplane` ((#v-global-imageconsuldataplane)) (`string: hashicorp/consul-dataplane:<latest supported version>`) - The name (and tag) of the consul-dataplane Docker image used for the
    connect-injected sidecar proxies and mesh, terminating, and ingress gateways.

  - `openshift` ((#v-global-openshift)) - Configuration for running this Helm chart on the Red Hat OpenShift platform.
    This Helm chart currently supports OpenShift v4.x+.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-openshift-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will create necessary configuration for running
      its components on OpenShift.

  - `consulAPITimeout` ((#v-global-consulapitimeout)) (`string: 5s`) - The time in seconds that the consul API client will wait for a response from
    the API before cancelling the request.

  - `cloud` ((#v-global-cloud)) - Enables installing an HCP Consul self-managed cluster.
    Requires Consul v1.14+.

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-cloud-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will enable the installation of an HCP Consul
      self-managed cluster.

    - `scadaAddress` ((#v-global-cloud-scadaaddress)) - The name of the Kubernetes secret that holds the HCP cloud scada address.
      This is optional when global.cloud.enabled is true.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-cloud-scadaaddress-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret that holds the scada address.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-cloud-scadaaddress-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes secret that holds the scada address.

  - `extraLabels` ((#v-global-extralabels)) (`map`) - Extra labels to attach to all pods, deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets, and jobs. This should be a YAML map.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      labelKey: label-value
      anotherLabelKey: another-label-value
    ```

### server ((#h-server))

- `server` ((#v-server)) - Server, when enabled, configures a server cluster to run. This should
  be disabled if you plan on connecting to a Consul cluster external to
  the Kube cluster.

  - `enabled` ((#v-server-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, the chart will install all the resources necessary for a
    Consul server cluster. If you're running Consul externally and want agents
    within Kubernetes to join that cluster, this should probably be false.

  - `image` ((#v-server-image)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Docker image (including any tag) for the containers running
    Consul server agents.

  - `replicas` ((#v-server-replicas)) (`integer: 1`) - The number of server agents to run. This determines the fault tolerance of
    the cluster. Please refer to the [deployment table](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/architecture/consensus#deployment-table)
    for more information.

  - `bootstrapExpect` ((#v-server-bootstrapexpect)) (`int: null`) - The number of servers that are expected to be running.
    It defaults to server.replicas.
    In most cases the default should be used, however if there are more
    servers in this datacenter than server.replicas it might make sense
    to override the default. This would be the case if two kube clusters
    were joined into the same datacenter and each cluster ran a certain number
    of servers.

  - `serverCert` ((#v-server-servercert)) - A secret containing a certificate & key for the server agents to use
    for TLS communication within the Consul cluster. Cert needs to be provided with
    additional DNS name SANs so that it will work within the Kubernetes cluster:

    Kubernetes Secrets backend:
    ```bash
    consul tls cert create -server -days=730 -domain=consul -ca=consul-agent-ca.pem \
        -key=consul-agent-ca-key.pem -dc={{datacenter}} \
        -additional-dnsname="{{fullname}}-server" \
        -additional-dnsname="*.{{fullname}}-server" \
        -additional-dnsname="*.{{fullname}}-server.{{namespace}}" \
        -additional-dnsname="*.{{fullname}}-server.{{namespace}}.svc" \
        -additional-dnsname="*.server.{{datacenter}}.{{domain}}" \
        -additional-dnsname="server.{{datacenter}}.{{domain}}"
    ```

    If you have generated the server-cert yourself with the consul CLI, you could use the following command
    to create the secret in Kubernetes:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic consul-server-cert \
        --from-file='tls.crt=./dc1-server-consul-0.pem'
        --from-file='tls.key=./dc1-server-consul-0-key.pem'
    ```

    Vault Secrets backend:
    If you are using Vault as a secrets backend, a Vault Policy must be created which allows `["create", "update"]`
    capabilities on the PKI issuing endpoint, which is usually of the form `pki/issue/consul-server`.
    Complete [this tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/vault-secure/vault-pki-consul-secure-tls)
    to learn how to generate a compatible certificate.
    Note: when using TLS, both the `server.serverCert` and `global.tls.caCert` which points to the CA endpoint of this PKI engine
    must be provided.

    - `secretName` ((#v-server-servercert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Vault secret that holds the PEM encoded server certificate.

  - `exposeGossipAndRPCPorts` ((#v-server-exposegossipandrpcports)) (`boolean: false`) - Exposes the servers' gossip and RPC ports as hostPorts. To enable a client
    agent outside of the k8s cluster to join the datacenter, you would need to
    enable `server.exposeGossipAndRPCPorts`, `client.exposeGossipPorts`, and
    set `server.ports.serflan.port` to a port not being used on the host. Since
    `client.exposeGossipPorts` uses the hostPort 8301,
    `server.ports.serflan.port` must be set to something other than 8301.

  - `ports` ((#v-server-ports)) - Configures ports for the consul servers.

    - `serflan` ((#v-server-ports-serflan)) - Configures the LAN gossip port for the consul servers. If you choose to
      enable `server.exposeGossipAndRPCPorts` and `client.exposeGossipPorts`,
      that will configure the LAN gossip ports on the servers and clients to be
      hostPorts, so if you are running clients and servers on the same node the
      ports will conflict if they are both 8301. When you enable
      `server.exposeGossipAndRPCPorts` and `client.exposeGossipPorts`, you must
      change this from the default to an unused port on the host, e.g. 9301. By
      default the LAN gossip port is 8301 and configured as a containerPort on
      the consul server Pods.

      - `port` ((#v-server-ports-serflan-port)) (`integer: 8301`)

  - `storage` ((#v-server-storage)) (`string: 10Gi`) - This defines the disk size for configuring the
    servers' StatefulSet storage. For dynamically provisioned storage classes, this is the
    desired size. For manually defined persistent volumes, this should be set to
    the disk size of the attached volume.

  - `storageClass` ((#v-server-storageclass)) (`string: null`) - The StorageClass to use for the servers' StatefulSet storage. It must be
    able to be dynamically provisioned if you want the storage
    to be automatically created. For example, to use
    local(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#local)
    storage classes, the PersistentVolumeClaims would need to be manually created.
    A `null` value will use the Kubernetes cluster's default StorageClass. If a default
    StorageClass does not exist, you will need to create one.
    Refer to the [Read/Write Tuning](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/install/performance#read-write-tuning)
    section of the Server Performance Requirements documentation for considerations
    around choosing a performant storage class.

    ~> **Note:** The [Reference Architecture](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/reference-architecture#hardware-sizing-for-consul-servers)
    contains best practices and recommendations for selecting suitable
    hardware sizes for your Consul servers.

  - `connect` ((#v-server-connect)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable [Connect](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect). Setting this to true
    _will not_ automatically secure pod communication, this
    setting will only enable usage of the feature. Consul will automatically initialize
    a new CA and set of certificates. Additional Connect settings can be configured
    by setting the `server.extraConfig` value.

  - `serviceAccount` ((#v-server-serviceaccount))

    - `annotations` ((#v-server-serviceaccount-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for the server service account. This should be formatted as a multi-line
      string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

  - `resources` ((#v-server-resources)) (`map`) - The resource requests (CPU, memory, etc.)
    for each of the server agents. This should be a YAML map corresponding to a Kubernetes
    [`ResourceRequirements``](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.24/#resourcerequirements-v1-core)
    object. NOTE: The use of a YAML string is deprecated.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: '200Mi'
        cpu: '100m'
      limits:
        memory: '200Mi'
        cpu: '100m'
    ```

  - `securityContext` ((#v-server-securitycontext)) (`map`) - The security context for the server pods. This should be a YAML map corresponding to a
    Kubernetes [SecurityContext](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) object.
    By default, servers will run as non-root, with user ID `100` and group ID `1000`,
    which correspond to the consul user and group created by the Consul docker image.
    Note: if running on OpenShift, this setting is ignored because the user and group are set automatically
    by the OpenShift platform.

  - `containerSecurityContext` ((#v-server-containersecuritycontext)) (`map`) - The container securityContext for each container in the server pods.  In
    addition to the Pod's SecurityContext this can
    set the capabilities of processes running in the container and ensure the
    root file systems in the container is read-only.

    - `server` ((#v-server-containersecuritycontext-server)) (`map`) - The consul server agent container

  - `updatePartition` ((#v-server-updatepartition)) (`integer: 0`) - This value is used to carefully
    control a rolling update of Consul server agents. This value specifies the
    [partition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#partitions)
    for performing a rolling update. Please read the linked Kubernetes
    and [Upgrade Consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/upgrade#upgrading-consul-servers)
    documentation for more information.

  - `disruptionBudget` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget)) - This configures the [`PodDisruptionBudget`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)
    for the server cluster.

    - `enabled` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - Enables registering a PodDisruptionBudget for the server
      cluster. If enabled, it only registers the budget so long as
      the server cluster is enabled. To disable, set to `false`.

    - `maxUnavailable` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget-maxunavailable)) (`integer: null`) - The maximum number of unavailable pods. By default, this will be
      automatically computed based on the `server.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`.
      If you need to set this to `0`, you will need to add a
      --set 'server.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'` flag to the helm chart installation
      command because of a limitation in the Helm templating language.

  - `extraConfig` ((#v-server-extraconfig)) (`string: {}`) - A raw string of extra [JSON configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files) for Consul
    servers. This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Consul
    server agents. This can be used to add additional configuration that
    isn't directly exposed by the chart.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraConfig: |
      {
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
      }
    ```

    This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag using the following syntax:

    ```shell-session
    --set 'server.extraConfig="{"log_level": "DEBUG"}"'
    ```

  - `extraVolumes` ((#v-server-extravolumes)) (`array<map>`) - A list of extra volumes to mount for server agents. This
    is useful for bringing in extra data that can be referenced by other configurations
    at a well known path, such as TLS certificates or Gossip encryption keys. The
    value of this should be a list of objects.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraVolumes:
      - type: secret
        name: consul-certs
        load: false
    ```

    Each object supports the following keys:

    - `type` - Type of the volume, must be one of "configMap" or "secret". Case sensitive.

    - `name` - Name of the configMap or secret to be mounted. This also controls
      the path that it is mounted to. The volume will be mounted to `/consul/userconfig/<name>`.

    - `load` - If true, then the agent will be
      configured to automatically load HCL/JSON configuration files from this volume
      with `-config-dir`. This defaults to false.

  - `extraContainers` ((#v-server-extracontainers)) (`array<map>`) - A list of sidecar containers.
    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraContainers:
    - name: extra-container
      image: example-image:latest
      command:
       - ...
    ```

  - `affinity` ((#v-server-affinity)) (`string`) - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
    for server pods. It defaults to allowing only a single server pod on each node, which
    minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need
    to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value
    to `null`.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: {{ template "consul.name" . }}
                release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
                component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    ```

  - `tolerations` ((#v-server-tolerations)) (`string: ""`) - Toleration settings for server pods. This
    should be a multi-line string matching the
    [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)
    array in a Pod spec.

  - `topologySpreadConstraints` ((#v-server-topologyspreadconstraints)) (`string: ""`) - Pod topology spread constraints for server pods.
    This should be a multi-line YAML string matching the
    [`topologySpreadConstraints`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/)
    array in a Pod Spec.

    This requires K8S >= 1.18 (beta) or 1.19 (stable).

    Example:

    ```yaml
    topologySpreadConstraints: |
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{ template "consul.name" . }}
            release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
            component: server
    ```

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-server-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
    labels for server pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-server-priorityclassname)) (`string: ""`) - This value references an existing
    Kubernetes [`priorityClassName`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority)
    that can be assigned to server pods.

  - `extraLabels` ((#v-server-extralabels)) (`map`) - Extra labels to attach to the server pods. This should be a YAML map.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      labelKey: label-value
      anotherLabelKey: another-label-value
    ```

  - `annotations` ((#v-server-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
    server pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

      - `https` ((#v-server-exposeservice-nodeport-https)) (`integer: null`) - Configures the nodePort to expose the Consul server https port.

      - `serf` ((#v-server-exposeservice-nodeport-serf)) (`integer: null`) - Configures the nodePort to expose the Consul server serf port.

      - `rpc` ((#v-server-exposeservice-nodeport-rpc)) (`integer: null`) - Configures the nodePort to expose the Consul server rpc port.

      - `grpc` ((#v-server-exposeservice-nodeport-grpc)) (`integer: null`) - Configures the nodePort to expose the Consul server grpc port.

    - `annotations` ((#v-server-exposeservice-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
      server pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

        "annotation-key": "annotation-value"
      ```

  - `extraEnvironmentVars` ((#v-server-extraenvironmentvars)) (`map`) - A list of extra environment variables to set within the stateful set.
    These could be used to include proxy settings required for cloud auto-join
    feature, in case kubernetes cluster is behind egress http proxies. Additionally,
    it could be used to configure custom consul parameters.

  - `snapshotAgent` ((#v-server-snapshotagent)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Values for setting up and running
    [snapshot agents](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/commands/snapshot/agent)
    within the Consul clusters. They run as a sidecar with Consul servers.

    - `enabled` ((#v-server-snapshotagent-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will install resources necessary to run the snapshot agent.

    - `interval` ((#v-server-snapshotagent-interval)) (`string: 1h`) - Interval at which to perform snapshots.
      Refer to [`interval`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/commands/snapshot/agent#interval)

    - `configSecret` ((#v-server-snapshotagent-configsecret)) - A Kubernetes or Vault secret that should be manually created to contain the entire
      config to be used on the snapshot agent.
      This is the preferred method of configuration since there are usually storage
      credentials present. Please refer to the [Snapshot agent config](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/commands/snapshot/agent#config-file-options)
      for details.

      - `secretName` ((#v-server-snapshotagent-configsecret-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret or Vault secret path that holds the snapshot agent config.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      caCert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIC7jCCApSgAwIBAgIRAIq2zQEVexqxvtxP6J0bXAwwCgYIKoZIzj0EAwIwgbkx
        ...
      ```

  - `auditLogs` ((#v-server-auditlogs)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Added in Consul 1.8, the audit object allow users to enable auditing
    and configure a sink and filters for their audit logs. Please refer to
    [audit logs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise/audit-logging) documentation
    for further information.

    - `enabled` ((#v-server-auditlogs-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - Controls whether Consul logs out each time a user performs an operation.
      global.acls.manageSystemACLs must be enabled to use this feature.

    - `sinks` ((#v-server-auditlogs-sinks)) (`array<map>`) - A single entry of the sink object provides configuration for the destination to which Consul
      will log auditing events.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      sinks:
        - name: My Sink
          type: file
          format: json
          path: /tmp/audit.json
          delivery_guarantee: best-effort
          rotate_duration: 24h
          rotate_max_files: 15
          rotate_bytes: 25165824

      ```

      The sink object supports the following keys:

      - `name` - Name of the sink.

      - `type` - Type specifies what kind of sink this is. Currently only file sinks are available

      - `format` - Format specifies what format the events will be emitted with. Currently only `json`
        events are emitted.

      - `path` - The directory and filename to write audit events to.

      - `delivery_guarantee` - Specifies the rules governing how audit events are written. Consul
        only supports `best-effort` event delivery.

      - `mode` - The permissions to set on the audit log files.

      - `rotate_duration` - Specifies the interval by which the system rotates to a new log file.
         At least one of `rotate_duration` or `rotate_bytes` must be configured to enable audit logging.

      - `rotate_bytes` -  Specifies how large an individual log file can grow before Consul rotates to a new file.
         At least one of rotate_bytes or rotate_duration must be configured to enable audit logging.

      - `rotate_max_files` - Defines the limit that Consul should follow before it deletes old log files.

### externalServers ((#h-externalservers))

- `externalServers` ((#v-externalservers)) - Configuration for Consul servers when the servers are running outside of Kubernetes.
  When running external servers, configuring these values is recommended
  if setting `global.tls.enableAutoEncrypt` to true
  or `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` to true.

  - `enabled` ((#v-externalservers-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will be configured to talk to the external servers.
    If setting this to true, you must also set `server.enabled` to false.

  - `hosts` ((#v-externalservers-hosts)) (`array<string>: []`) - An array of external Consul server hosts that are used to make
    HTTPS connections from the components in this Helm chart.
    Valid values include an IP, a DNS name, or an [exec=](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-netaddrs) string.
    The port must be provided separately below.
    Note: This slice can only contain a single element.
    Note: If enabling clients, `client.join` must also be set to the hosts that should be
    used to join the cluster. In most cases, the `client.join` values
    should be the same, however, they may be different if you
    wish to use separate hosts for the HTTPS connections.

  - `httpsPort` ((#v-externalservers-httpsport)) (`integer: 8501`) - The HTTPS port of the Consul servers.

  - `grpcPort` ((#v-externalservers-grpcport)) (`integer: 8502`) - The GRPC port of the Consul servers.

  - `tlsServerName` ((#v-externalservers-tlsservername)) (`string: null`) - The server name to use as the SNI host header when connecting with HTTPS.

  - `useSystemRoots` ((#v-externalservers-usesystemroots)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, consul-k8s-control-plane components will ignore the CA set in
    `global.tls.caCert` when making HTTPS calls to Consul servers and
    will instead use the consul-k8s-control-plane image's system CAs for TLS verification.
    If false, consul-k8s-control-plane components will use `global.tls.caCert` when
    making HTTPS calls to Consul servers.
    **NOTE:** This does not affect Consul's internal RPC communication which will
    always use `global.tls.caCert`.

  - `k8sAuthMethodHost` ((#v-externalservers-k8sauthmethodhost)) (`string: null`) - If you are setting `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` and
    `connectInject.enabled` to true, set `k8sAuthMethodHost` to the address of the Kubernetes API server.
    This address must be reachable from the Consul servers.
    Please refer to the [Kubernetes Auth Method documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods/kubernetes).

    You could retrieve this value from your `kubeconfig` by running:

    ```shell-session
    $ kubectl config view \
      -o jsonpath="{.clusters[?(@.name=='<your cluster name>')].cluster.server}"
    ```

  - `skipServerWatch` ((#v-externalservers-skipserverwatch)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, setting this prevents the consul-dataplane and consul-k8s components from watching the Consul servers for changes. This is
    useful for situations where Consul servers are behind a load balancer.

### client ((#h-client))

- `client` ((#v-client)) - Values that configure running a Consul client on Kubernetes nodes.

  - `enabled` ((#v-client-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will install all
    the resources necessary for a Consul client on every Kubernetes node. This _does not_ require
    `server.enabled`, since the agents can be configured to join an external cluster.

  - `image` ((#v-client-image)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Docker image (including any tag) for the containers
    running Consul client agents.

  - `join` ((#v-client-join)) (`array<string>: null`) - A list of valid [`-retry-join` values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_retry_join).
    If this is `null` (default), then the clients will attempt to automatically
    join the server cluster running within Kubernetes.
    This means that with `server.enabled` set to true, clients will automatically
    join that cluster. If `server.enabled` is not true, then a value must be
    specified so the clients can join a valid cluster.

  - `dataDirectoryHostPath` ((#v-client-datadirectoryhostpath)) (`string: null`) - An absolute path to a directory on the host machine to use as the Consul
    client data directory. If set to the empty string or null, the Consul agent
    will store its data in the Pod's local filesystem (which will
    be lost if the Pod is deleted). Security Warning: If setting this, Pod Security
    Policies _must_ be enabled on your cluster and in this Helm chart (via the
    `global.enablePodSecurityPolicies` setting) to prevent other pods from
    mounting the same host path and gaining access to all of Consul's data.
    Consul's data is not encrypted at rest.

  - `grpc` ((#v-client-grpc)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, agents will enable their GRPC listener on
    port 8502 and expose it to the host. This will use slightly more resources, but is
    required for Connect.

  - `nodeMeta` ((#v-client-nodemeta)) - nodeMeta specifies an arbitrary metadata key/value pair to associate with the node
    (refer to [`-node-meta`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/cli-flags#_node_meta))

    - `pod-name` ((#v-client-nodemeta-pod-name)) (`string: ${HOSTNAME}`)

    - `host-ip` ((#v-client-nodemeta-host-ip)) (`string: ${HOST_IP}`)

  - `exposeGossipPorts` ((#v-client-exposegossipports)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will expose the clients' gossip ports as hostPorts.
    This is only necessary if pod IPs in the k8s cluster are not directly routable
    and the Consul servers are outside of the k8s cluster.
    This also changes the clients' advertised IP to the `hostIP` rather than `podIP`.

  - `serviceAccount` ((#v-client-serviceaccount))

    - `annotations` ((#v-client-serviceaccount-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for the client service account. This should be formatted as a multi-line
      string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

  - `resources` ((#v-client-resources)) (`map`) - The resource settings for Client agents.
    NOTE: The use of a YAML string is deprecated. Instead, set directly as a
    YAML map.

  - `securityContext` ((#v-client-securitycontext)) (`map`) - The security context for the client pods. This should be a YAML map corresponding to a
    Kubernetes [SecurityContext](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) object.
    By default, servers will run as non-root, with user ID `100` and group ID `1000`,
    which correspond to the consul user and group created by the Consul docker image.
    Note: if running on OpenShift, this setting is ignored because the user and group are set automatically
    by the OpenShift platform.

  - `containerSecurityContext` ((#v-client-containersecuritycontext)) (`map`) - The container securityContext for each container in the client pods.  In
    addition to the Pod's SecurityContext this can
    set the capabilities of processes running in the container and ensure the
    root file systems in the container is read-only.

    - `client` ((#v-client-containersecuritycontext-client)) (`map`) - The consul client agent container

    - `aclInit` ((#v-client-containersecuritycontext-aclinit)) (`map`) - The acl-init initContainer

    - `tlsInit` ((#v-client-containersecuritycontext-tlsinit)) (`map`) - The tls-init initContainer

  - `extraConfig` ((#v-client-extraconfig)) (`string: {}`) - A raw string of extra [JSON configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files) for Consul
    clients. This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Consul
    client agents. This can be used to add additional configuration that
    isn't directly exposed by the chart.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraConfig: |
      {
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
      }
    ```

    This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag using the following syntax:

    ```shell-session
    --set 'client.extraConfig="{"log_level": "DEBUG"}"'
    ```

  - `extraVolumes` ((#v-client-extravolumes)) (`array<map>`) - A list of extra volumes to mount for client agents. This
    is useful for bringing in extra data that can be referenced by other configurations
    at a well known path, such as TLS certificates or Gossip encryption keys. The
    value of this should be a list of objects.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraVolumes:
      - type: secret
        name: consul-certs
        load: false
    ```

    Each object supports the following keys:

    - `type` - Type of the volume, must be one of "configMap" or "secret". Case sensitive.

    - `name` - Name of the configMap or secret to be mounted. This also controls
      the path that it is mounted to. The volume will be mounted to `/consul/userconfig/<name>`.

    - `load` - If true, then the agent will be
      configured to automatically load HCL/JSON configuration files from this volume
      with `-config-dir`. This defaults to false.

  - `extraContainers` ((#v-client-extracontainers)) (`array<map>`) - A list of sidecar containers.
    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraContainers:
    - name: extra-container
      image: example-image:latest
      command:
       - ...
    ```

  - `tolerations` ((#v-client-tolerations)) (`string: ""`) - Toleration Settings for Client pods
    This should be a multi-line string matching the Toleration array
    in a PodSpec.
    The example below will allow Client pods to run on every node
    regardless of taints

    ```yaml
    tolerations: |
      - operator: Exists
    ```

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-client-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - nodeSelector labels for client pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.
    ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector

    Example:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `affinity` ((#v-client-affinity)) (`string: null`) - Affinity Settings for Client pods, formatted as a multi-line YAML string.
    ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity

    Example:

    ```yaml
    affinity: |
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
              operator: DoesNotExist
    ```

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-client-priorityclassname)) (`string: ""`) - This value references an existing
    Kubernetes [`priorityClassName`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority)
    that can be assigned to client pods.

  - `annotations` ((#v-client-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
    client pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `extraLabels` ((#v-client-extralabels)) (`map`) - Extra labels to attach to the client pods. This should be a regular YAML map.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      labelKey: label-value
      anotherLabelKey: another-label-value
    ```

  - `extraEnvironmentVars` ((#v-client-extraenvironmentvars)) (`map`) - A list of extra environment variables to set within the stateful set.
    These could be used to include proxy settings required for cloud auto-join
    feature, in case kubernetes cluster is behind egress http proxies. Additionally,
    it could be used to configure custom consul parameters.

  - `dnsPolicy` ((#v-client-dnspolicy)) (`string: null`) - This value defines the [Pod DNS policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy)
    for client pods to use.

  - `hostNetwork` ((#v-client-hostnetwork)) (`boolean: false`) - hostNetwork defines whether or not we use host networking instead of hostPort in the event
    that a CNI plugin doesn't support `hostPort`. This has security implications and is not recommended
    as doing so gives the consul client unnecessary access to all network traffic on the host.
    In most cases, pod network and host network are on different networks so this should be
    combined with `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`

  - `updateStrategy` ((#v-client-updatestrategy)) (`string: null`) - updateStrategy for the DaemonSet.
    Refer to the Kubernetes [Daemonset upgrade strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/#daemonset-update-strategy)
    documentation.
    This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to the updateStrategy

    Example:

    ```yaml
    updateStrategy: |
      rollingUpdate:
        maxUnavailable: 5
      type: RollingUpdate
    ```

### dns ((#h-dns))

- `dns` ((#v-dns)) - Configuration for DNS configuration within the Kubernetes cluster.
  This creates a service that routes to all agents (client or server)
  for serving DNS requests. This DOES NOT automatically configure kube-dns
  today, so you must still manually configure a `stubDomain` with kube-dns
  for this to have any effect:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configure-stub-domain-and-upstream-dns-servers

  - `enabled` ((#v-dns-enabled)) (`boolean: -`)

  - `enableRedirection` ((#v-dns-enableredirection)) (`boolean: -`) - If true, services using Consul Connect will use Consul DNS
    for default DNS resolution. The DNS lookups fall back to the nameserver IPs
    listed in /etc/resolv.conf if not found in Consul.

  - `type` ((#v-dns-type)) (`string: ClusterIP`) - Used to control the type of service created. For
    example, setting this to "LoadBalancer" will create an external load
    balancer (for supported K8S installations)

  - `clusterIP` ((#v-dns-clusterip)) (`string: null`) - Set a predefined cluster IP for the DNS service.
    Useful if you need to reference the DNS service's IP
    address in CoreDNS config.

  - `annotations` ((#v-dns-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Extra annotations to attach to the dns service
    This should be a multi-line string of
    annotations to apply to the dns Service

  - `additionalSpec` ((#v-dns-additionalspec)) (`string: null`) - Additional ServiceSpec values
    This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes
    ServiceSpec object.

### ui ((#h-ui))

- `ui` ((#v-ui)) - Values that configure the Consul UI.

  - `enabled` ((#v-ui-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, the UI will be enabled. This will
    only _enable_ the UI, it doesn't automatically register any service for external
    access. The UI will only be enabled on server agents. If `server.enabled` is
    false, then this setting has no effect. To expose the UI in some way, you must
    configure `ui.service`.

  - `service` ((#v-ui-service)) - Configure the service for the Consul UI.

    - `enabled` ((#v-ui-service-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable registering a
      Kubernetes Service for the Consul UI. This value only takes effect if `ui.enabled` is
      true and taking effect.

    - `type` ((#v-ui-service-type)) (`string: null`) - The service type to register.

    - `port` ((#v-ui-service-port)) - Set the port value of the UI service.

      - `http` ((#v-ui-service-port-http)) (`integer: 80`) - HTTP port.

      - `https` ((#v-ui-service-port-https)) (`integer: 443`) - HTTPS port.

    - `nodePort` ((#v-ui-service-nodeport)) - Optionally set the nodePort value of the ui service if using a NodePort service.
      If not set and using a NodePort service, Kubernetes will automatically assign
      a port.

      - `http` ((#v-ui-service-nodeport-http)) (`integer: null`) - HTTP node port

      - `https` ((#v-ui-service-nodeport-https)) (`integer: null`) - HTTPS node port

    - `annotations` ((#v-ui-service-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Annotations to apply to the UI service.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        'annotation-key': annotation-value
      ```

    - `additionalSpec` ((#v-ui-service-additionalspec)) (`string: null`) - Additional ServiceSpec values
      This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes
      ServiceSpec object.

  - `ingress` ((#v-ui-ingress)) - Configure Ingress for the Consul UI.
    If `global.tls.enabled` is set to `true`, the Ingress will expose
    the port 443 on the UI service. Please ensure the Ingress Controller
    supports SSL pass-through and it is enabled to ensure traffic forwarded
    to port 443 has not been TLS terminated.

    - `enabled` ((#v-ui-ingress-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - This will create an Ingress resource for the Consul UI.

    - `ingressClassName` ((#v-ui-ingress-ingressclassname)) (`string: ""`) - Optionally set the ingressClassName.

    - `pathType` ((#v-ui-ingress-pathtype)) (`string: Prefix`) - pathType override - refer to: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types

    - `hosts` ((#v-ui-ingress-hosts)) (`array<map>`) - hosts is a list of host name to create Ingress rules.

      ```yaml
      hosts:
        - host: foo.bar
          paths:
            - /example
            - /test
      ```

    - `tls` ((#v-ui-ingress-tls)) (`array<map>`) - tls is a list of hosts and secret name in an Ingress
      which tells the Ingress controller to secure the channel.

      ```yaml
      tls:
        - hosts:
          - chart-example.local
          secretName: testsecret-tls
      ```

    - `annotations` ((#v-ui-ingress-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Annotations to apply to the UI ingress.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        'annotation-key': annotation-value
      ```

  - `metrics` ((#v-ui-metrics)) - Configurations for displaying metrics in the UI.

    - `enabled` ((#v-ui-metrics-enabled)) (`boolean: global.metrics.enabled`) - Enable displaying metrics in the UI. The default value of "-"
      will inherit from `global.metrics.enabled` value.

    - `provider` ((#v-ui-metrics-provider)) (`string: prometheus`) - Provider for metrics. Refer to
      [`metrics_provider`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#ui_config_metrics_provider)
      This value is only used if `ui.enabled` is set to true.

    - `baseURL` ((#v-ui-metrics-baseurl)) (`string: http://prometheus-server`) - baseURL is the URL of the prometheus server, usually the service URL.
      This value is only used if `ui.enabled` is set to true.

  - `dashboardURLTemplates` ((#v-ui-dashboardurltemplates)) - Corresponds to [`dashboard_url_templates`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#ui_config_dashboard_url_templates)
    configuration.

    - `service` ((#v-ui-dashboardurltemplates-service)) (`string: ""`) - Sets [`dashboardURLTemplates.service`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#ui_config_dashboard_url_templates_service).

### syncCatalog ((#h-synccatalog))

- `syncCatalog` ((#v-synccatalog)) - Configure the catalog sync process to sync K8S with Consul
  services. This can run bidirectional (default) or unidirectionally (Consul
  to K8S or K8S to Consul only).

  This process assumes that a Consul agent is available on the host IP.
  This is done automatically if clients are enabled. If clients are not
  enabled then set the node selection so that it chooses a node with a
  Consul agent.

  - `enabled` ((#v-synccatalog-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - True if you want to enable the catalog sync. Set to "-" to inherit from
    global.enabled.

  - `image` ((#v-synccatalog-image)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Docker image (including any tag) for consul-k8s-control-plane
    to run the sync program.

  - `default` ((#v-synccatalog-default)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, all valid services in K8S are
    synced by default. If false, the service must be [annotated](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/service-sync#enable-and-disable-sync)
    properly to sync.
    In either case an annotation can override the default.

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-synccatalog-priorityclassname)) (`string: ""`) - Optional priorityClassName.

  - `toConsul` ((#v-synccatalog-toconsul)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, will sync Kubernetes services to Consul. This can be disabled to
    have a one-way sync.

  - `toK8S` ((#v-synccatalog-tok8s)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, will sync Consul services to Kubernetes. This can be disabled to
    have a one-way sync.

  - `k8sPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sprefix)) (`string: null`) - Service prefix to prepend to services before registering
    with Kubernetes. For example "consul-" will register all services
    prepended with "consul-". (Consul -> Kubernetes sync)

  - `k8sAllowNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sallownamespaces)) (`array<string>: ["*"]`) - List of k8s namespaces to sync the k8s services from.
    If a k8s namespace is not included in this list or is listed in `k8sDenyNamespaces`,
    services in that k8s namespace will not be synced even if they are explicitly
    annotated. Use `["*"]` to automatically allow all k8s namespaces.

    For example, `["namespace1", "namespace2"]` will only allow services in the k8s
    namespaces `namespace1` and `namespace2` to be synced and registered
    with Consul. All other k8s namespaces will be ignored.

    To deny all namespaces, set this to `[]`.

    Note: `k8sDenyNamespaces` takes precedence over values defined here.

  - `k8sDenyNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sdenynamespaces)) (`array<string>: ["kube-system", "kube-public"]`) - List of k8s namespaces that should not have their
    services synced. This list takes precedence over `k8sAllowNamespaces`.
    `*` is not supported because then nothing would be allowed to sync.

    For example, if `k8sAllowNamespaces` is `["*"]` and `k8sDenyNamespaces` is
    `["namespace1", "namespace2"]`, then all k8s namespaces besides `namespace1`
    and `namespace2` will be synced.

  - `k8sSourceNamespace` ((#v-synccatalog-k8ssourcenamespace)) (`string: null`) - [DEPRECATED] Use k8sAllowNamespaces and k8sDenyNamespaces instead. For
    backwards compatibility, if both this and the allow/deny lists are set,
    the allow/deny lists will be ignored.
    k8sSourceNamespace is the Kubernetes namespace to watch for service
    changes and sync to Consul. If this is not set then it will default
    to all namespaces.

  - `consulNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> These settings manage the catalog sync's interaction with
    Consul namespaces (requires consul-ent v1.7+).
    Also, `global.enableConsulNamespaces` must be true.

    - `consulDestinationNamespace` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-consuldestinationnamespace)) (`string: default`) - Name of the Consul namespace to register all
      k8s services into. If the Consul namespace does not already exist,
      it will be created. This will be ignored if `mirroringK8S` is true.

    - `mirroringK8S` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8s)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, k8s services will be registered into a Consul namespace
      of the same name as their k8s namespace, optionally prefixed if
      `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set below. If the Consul namespace does not
      already exist, it will be created. Turning this on overrides the
      `consulDestinationNamespace` setting.
      `addK8SNamespaceSuffix` may no longer be needed if enabling this option.
      If mirroring is enabled, avoid creating any Consul resources in the following
      Kubernetes namespaces, as Consul currently reserves these namespaces for
      system use: "system", "universal", "operator", "root".

    - `mirroringK8SPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8sprefix)) (`string: ""`) - If `mirroringK8S` is set to true, `mirroringK8SPrefix` allows each Consul namespace
      to be given a prefix. For example, if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set to "k8s-", a
      service in the k8s `staging` namespace will be registered into the
      `k8s-staging` Consul namespace.

  - `addK8SNamespaceSuffix` ((#v-synccatalog-addk8snamespacesuffix)) (`boolean: true`) - Appends Kubernetes namespace suffix to
    each service name synced to Consul, separated by a dash.
    For example, for a service 'foo' in the default namespace,
    the sync process will create a Consul service named 'foo-default'.
    Set this flag to true to avoid registering services with the same name
    but in different namespaces as instances for the same Consul service.
    Namespace suffix is not added if 'annotationServiceName' is provided.

  - `consulPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-consulprefix)) (`string: null`) - Service prefix which prepends itself
    to Kubernetes services registered within Consul
    For example, "k8s-" will register all services prepended with "k8s-".
    (Kubernetes -> Consul sync)
    consulPrefix is ignored when 'annotationServiceName' is provided.
    NOTE: Updating this property to a non-null value for an existing installation will result in deregistering
    of existing services in Consul and registering them with a new name.

  - `k8sTag` ((#v-synccatalog-k8stag)) (`string: null`) - Optional tag that is applied to all of the Kubernetes services
    that are synced into Consul. If nothing is set, defaults to "k8s".
    (Kubernetes -> Consul sync)

  - `consulNodeName` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnodename)) (`string: k8s-sync`) - Defines the Consul synthetic node that all services
    will be registered to.
    NOTE: Changing the node name and upgrading the Helm chart will leave
    all of the previously sync'd services registered with Consul and
    register them again under the new Consul node name. The out-of-date
    registrations will need to be explicitly removed.

  - `syncClusterIPServices` ((#v-synccatalog-syncclusteripservices)) (`boolean: true`) - Syncs services of the ClusterIP type, which may
    or may not be broadly accessible depending on your Kubernetes cluster.
    Set this to false to skip syncing ClusterIP services.

  - `ingress` ((#v-synccatalog-ingress))

    - `enabled` ((#v-synccatalog-ingress-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - Syncs the hostname from a Kubernetes Ingress resource to service registrations
      when a rule matched a service. Currently only supports host based routing and
      not path based routing. The only supported path on an ingress rule is "/".
      Set this to false to skip syncing Ingress services.

      Currently, port 80 is synced if there is not TLS entry for the hostname. Syncs the port
      443 if there is a TLS entry that matches the hostname.

    - `loadBalancerIPs` ((#v-synccatalog-ingress-loadbalancerips)) (`boolean: false`) - Requires syncIngress to be `true`. syncs the LoadBalancer IP from a Kubernetes Ingress
      resource instead of the hostname to service registrations when a rule matched a service.

  - `nodePortSyncType` ((#v-synccatalog-nodeportsynctype)) (`string: ExternalFirst`) - Configures the type of syncing that happens for NodePort
    services. The valid options are: ExternalOnly, InternalOnly, ExternalFirst.

    - ExternalOnly will only use a node's ExternalIP address for the sync
    - InternalOnly use's the node's InternalIP address
    - ExternalFirst will preferentially use the node's ExternalIP address, but
      if it doesn't exist, it will use the node's InternalIP address instead.

  - `aclSyncToken` ((#v-synccatalog-aclsynctoken)) - Refers to a Kubernetes secret that you have created that contains
    an ACL token for your Consul cluster which allows the sync process the correct
    permissions. This is only needed if ACLs are managed manually within the Consul cluster, i.e. `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` is `false`.

    - `secretName` ((#v-synccatalog-aclsynctoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret that holds the acl sync token.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-synccatalog-aclsynctoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Kubernetes secret that holds the acl sync token.

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-synccatalog-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
    labels for catalog sync pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `affinity` ((#v-synccatalog-affinity)) (`string: null`) - Affinity Settings
    This should be a multi-line string matching the affinity object

  - `tolerations` ((#v-synccatalog-tolerations)) (`string: null`) - Toleration Settings
    This should be a multi-line string matching the Toleration array
    in a PodSpec.

  - `serviceAccount` ((#v-synccatalog-serviceaccount))

    - `annotations` ((#v-synccatalog-serviceaccount-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for the mesh gateways' service account. This should be formatted as a
      multi-line string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

  - `resources` ((#v-synccatalog-resources)) (`map`) - The resource settings for sync catalog pods.

  - `logLevel` ((#v-synccatalog-loglevel)) (`string: ""`) - Override global log verbosity level. One of "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".

  - `consulWriteInterval` ((#v-synccatalog-consulwriteinterval)) (`string: null`) - Override the default interval to perform syncing operations creating Consul services.

  - `extraLabels` ((#v-synccatalog-extralabels)) (`map`) - Extra labels to attach to the sync catalog pods. This should be a YAML map.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      labelKey: label-value
      anotherLabelKey: another-label-value
    ```

  - `annotations` ((#v-synccatalog-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
    the catalog sync pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

### connectInject ((#h-connectinject))

- `connectInject` ((#v-connectinject)) - Configures the automatic Connect sidecar injector.

  - `enabled` ((#v-connectinject-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - True if you want to enable connect injection. Set to "-" to inherit from
    global.enabled.

  - `replicas` ((#v-connectinject-replicas)) (`integer: 1`) - The number of deployment replicas.

  - `image` ((#v-connectinject-image)) (`string: null`) - Image for consul-k8s-control-plane that contains the injector.

  - `default` ((#v-connectinject-default)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the injector will inject the
    Connect sidecar into all pods by default. Otherwise, pods must specify the
    [injection annotation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/connect#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-inject)
    to opt-in to Connect injection. If this is true, pods can use the same annotation
    to explicitly opt-out of injection.

  - `transparentProxy` ((#v-connectinject-transparentproxy)) - Configures Transparent Proxy for Consul Service mesh services.
    Using this feature requires Consul 1.10.0-beta1+.

    - `defaultEnabled` ((#v-connectinject-transparentproxy-defaultenabled)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, then all Consul Service mesh will run with transparent proxy enabled by default,
      i.e. we enforce that all traffic within the pod will go through the proxy.
      This value is overridable via the "consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy" pod annotation.

    - `defaultOverwriteProbes` ((#v-connectinject-transparentproxy-defaultoverwriteprobes)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, we will overwrite Kubernetes HTTP probes of the pod to point to the Envoy proxy instead.
      This setting is recommended because with traffic being enforced to go through the Envoy proxy,
      the probes on the pod will fail because kube-proxy doesn't have the right certificates
      to talk to Envoy.
      This value is also overridable via the "consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-overwrite-probes" annotation.
      Note: This value has no effect if transparent proxy is disabled on the pod.

  - `disruptionBudget` ((#v-connectinject-disruptionbudget)) - This configures the [`PodDisruptionBudget`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)
    for the service mesh sidecar injector.

    - `enabled` ((#v-connectinject-disruptionbudget-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable registering a PodDisruptionBudget for the
      service mesh sidecar injector. If this is enabled, it will only register the budget so long as
      the service mesh is enabled.

    - `maxUnavailable` ((#v-connectinject-disruptionbudget-maxunavailable)) (`integer: null`) - The maximum number of unavailable pods. By default, this will be
      automatically computed based on the `connectInject.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`.
      If you need to set this to `0`, you will need to add a
      --set 'connectInject.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'` flag to the helm chart installation
      command because of a limitation in the Helm templating language.

    - `minAvailable` ((#v-connectinject-disruptionbudget-minavailable)) (`integer: null`) - The minimum number of available pods.
      Takes precedence over maxUnavailable if set.

  - `cni` ((#v-connectinject-cni)) - Configures consul-cni plugin for Consul Service mesh services

    - `enabled` ((#v-connectinject-cni-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, then all traffic redirection setup uses the consul-cni plugin.
      Requires connectInject.enabled to also be true.

    - `logLevel` ((#v-connectinject-cni-loglevel)) (`string: null`) - Log level for the installer and plugin. Overrides global.logLevel

    - `namespace` ((#v-connectinject-cni-namespace)) (`string: null`) - Set the namespace to install the CNI plugin into. Overrides global namespace settings for CNI resources.
      Ex: "kube-system"

    - `cniBinDir` ((#v-connectinject-cni-cnibindir)) (`string: /opt/cni/bin`) - Location on the kubernetes node where the CNI plugin is installed. Shoud be the absolute path and start with a '/'
      Example on GKE:

      ```yaml
      cniBinDir: "/home/kubernetes/bin"
      ```

    - `cniNetDir` ((#v-connectinject-cni-cninetdir)) (`string: /etc/cni/net.d`) - Location on the kubernetes node of all CNI configuration. Should be the absolute path and start with a '/'

    - `multus` ((#v-connectinject-cni-multus)) (`string: false`) - If multus CNI plugin is enabled with consul-cni. When enabled, consul-cni will not be installed as a chained
      CNI plugin. Instead, a NetworkAttachementDefinition CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) will be created in the helm
      release namespace. Following multus plugin standards, an annotation is required in order for the consul-cni plugin
      to be executed and for your service to be added to the Consul Service Mesh.

      Add the annotation `'k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks': '[{ "name":"consul-cni","namespace": "consul" }]'` to your pod
      to use the default installed NetworkAttachementDefinition CRD.

      Please refer to the [Multus Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md)
      for more information about using multus.

    - `resources` ((#v-connectinject-cni-resources)) (`map`) - The resource settings for CNI installer daemonset.

    - `resourceQuota` ((#v-connectinject-cni-resourcequota)) - Resource quotas for running the daemonset as system critical pods

      - `pods` ((#v-connectinject-cni-resourcequota-pods)) (`integer: 5000`)

    - `securityContext` ((#v-connectinject-cni-securitycontext)) (`map`) - The security context for the CNI installer daemonset. This should be a YAML map corresponding to a
      Kubernetes [SecurityContext](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) object.
      By default, servers will run as root, with user ID `0` and group ID `0`.
      Note: if running on OpenShift, this setting is ignored because the user and group are set automatically
      by the OpenShift platform.

    - `updateStrategy` ((#v-connectinject-cni-updatestrategy)) (`string: null`) - updateStrategy for the CNI installer DaemonSet.
      Refer to the Kubernetes [Daemonset upgrade strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/#daemonset-update-strategy)
      documentation.
      This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to the updateStrategy

      Example:

      ```yaml
      updateStrategy: |
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 5
        type: RollingUpdate
      ```

  - `consulNode` ((#v-connectinject-consulnode))

    - `meta` ((#v-connectinject-consulnode-meta)) (`map`) - meta specifies an arbitrary metadata key/value pair to associate with the node.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      meta:
        cluster: test-cluster
        persistent: true
      ```

  - `metrics` ((#v-connectinject-metrics)) - Configures metrics for Consul Connect services. All values are overridable
    via annotations on a per-pod basis.

    - `defaultEnabled` ((#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultenabled)) (`string: -`) - If true, the connect-injector will automatically
      add prometheus annotations to connect-injected pods. It will also
      add a listener on the Envoy sidecar to expose metrics. The exposed
      metrics will depend on whether metrics merging is enabled:
        - If metrics merging is enabled:
          the consul-dataplane will run a merged metrics server
          combining Envoy sidecar and Connect service metrics,
          i.e. if your service exposes its own Prometheus metrics.
        - If metrics merging is disabled:
          the listener will just expose Envoy sidecar metrics.
      This will inherit from `global.metrics.enabled`.

    - `defaultEnableMerging` ((#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultenablemerging)) (`boolean: false`) - Configures the consul-dataplane to run a merged metrics server
      to combine and serve both Envoy and Connect service metrics.
      This feature is available only in Consul v1.10.0 or greater.

    - `defaultMergedMetricsPort` ((#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultmergedmetricsport)) (`integer: 20100`) - Configures the port at which the consul-dataplane will listen on to return
      combined metrics. This port only needs to be changed if it conflicts with
      the application's ports.

    - `defaultPrometheusScrapePort` ((#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultprometheusscrapeport)) (`integer: 20200`) - Configures the port Prometheus will scrape metrics from, by configuring
      the Pod annotation `prometheus.io/port` and the corresponding listener in
      the Envoy sidecar.
      NOTE: This is *not* the port that your application exposes metrics on.
      That can be configured with the
      `consul.hashicorp.com/service-metrics-port` annotation.

    - `defaultPrometheusScrapePath` ((#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultprometheusscrapepath)) (`string: /metrics`) - Configures the path Prometheus will scrape metrics from, by configuring the pod
      annotation `prometheus.io/path` and the corresponding handler in the Envoy
      sidecar.
      NOTE: This is *not* the path that your application exposes metrics on.
      That can be configured with the
      `consul.hashicorp.com/service-metrics-path` annotation.

  - `envoyExtraArgs` ((#v-connectinject-envoyextraargs)) (`string: null`) - Used to pass arguments to the injected envoy sidecar.
    Valid arguments to pass to envoy can be found here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli
    e.g "--log-level debug --disable-hot-restart"

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-connectinject-priorityclassname)) (`string: ""`) - Optional priorityClassName.

  - `extraLabels` ((#v-connectinject-extralabels)) (`map`) - Extra labels to attach to the connect inject pods. This should be a YAML map.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      labelKey: label-value
      anotherLabelKey: another-label-value
    ```

  - `annotations` ((#v-connectinject-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for
    connect inject pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `imageConsul` ((#v-connectinject-imageconsul)) (`string: null`) - The Docker image for Consul to use when performing Connect injection.
    Defaults to global.image.

  - `logLevel` ((#v-connectinject-loglevel)) (`string: ""`) - Override global log verbosity level. One of "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".

  - `serviceAccount` ((#v-connectinject-serviceaccount))

    - `annotations` ((#v-connectinject-serviceaccount-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for the injector service account. This should be formatted as a
      multi-line string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

  - `resources` ((#v-connectinject-resources)) (`map`) - The resource settings for connect inject pods. The defaults, are optimized for getting started worklows on developer deployments. The settings should be tweaked for production deployments.

    - `requests` ((#v-connectinject-resources-requests))

      - `memory` ((#v-connectinject-resources-requests-memory)) (`string: 200Mi`) - Recommended production default: 500Mi

      - `cpu` ((#v-connectinject-resources-requests-cpu)) (`string: 50m`) - Recommended production default: 250m

    - `limits` ((#v-connectinject-resources-limits))

      - `memory` ((#v-connectinject-resources-limits-memory)) (`string: 200Mi`) - Recommended production default: 500Mi

      - `cpu` ((#v-connectinject-resources-limits-cpu)) (`string: 50m`) - Recommended production default: 250m

  - `failurePolicy` ((#v-connectinject-failurepolicy)) (`string: Fail`) - Sets the failurePolicy for the mutating webhook. By default this will cause pods not part of the consul installation to fail scheduling while the webhook
    is offline. This prevents a pod from skipping mutation if the webhook were to be momentarily offline.
    Once the webhook is back online the pod will be scheduled.
    In some environments such as Kind this may have an undesirable effect as it may prevent volume provisioner pods from running
    which can lead to hangs. In these environments it is recommend to use "Ignore" instead.
    This setting can be safely disabled by setting to "Ignore".

  - `namespaceSelector` ((#v-connectinject-namespaceselector)) (`string`) - Selector for restricting the webhook to only specific namespaces.
    Use with `connectInject.default: true` to automatically inject all pods in namespaces that match the selector. This should be set to a multiline string.
    Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-namespaceselector
    for more details.

    By default, we exclude kube-system since usually users won't
    want those pods injected and local-path-storage and openebs so that
    Kind (Kubernetes In Docker) and [OpenEBS](https://openebs.io/) respectively can provision Pods used to create PVCs.
    Note that this exclusion is only supported in Kubernetes v1.21.1+.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    namespaceSelector: |
      matchLabels:
        namespace-label: label-value
    ```

  - `k8sAllowNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-k8sallownamespaces)) (`array<string>: ["*"]`) - List of k8s namespaces to allow Connect sidecar
    injection in. If a k8s namespace is not included or is listed in `k8sDenyNamespaces`,
    pods in that k8s namespace will not be injected even if they are explicitly
    annotated. Use `["*"]` to automatically allow all k8s namespaces.

    For example, `["namespace1", "namespace2"]` will only allow pods in the k8s
    namespaces `namespace1` and `namespace2` to have Connect sidecars injected
    and registered with Consul. All other k8s namespaces will be ignored.

    To deny all namespaces, set this to `[]`.

    Note: `k8sDenyNamespaces` takes precedence over values defined here and
    `namespaceSelector` takes precedence over both since it is applied first.
    `kube-system` and `kube-public` are never injected, even if included here.

  - `k8sDenyNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-k8sdenynamespaces)) (`array<string>: []`) - List of k8s namespaces that should not allow Connect
    sidecar injection. This list takes precedence over `k8sAllowNamespaces`.
    `*` is not supported because then nothing would be allowed to be injected.

    For example, if `k8sAllowNamespaces` is `["*"]` and k8sDenyNamespaces is
    `["namespace1", "namespace2"]`, then all k8s namespaces besides "namespace1"
    and "namespace2" will be available for injection.

    Note: `namespaceSelector` takes precedence over this since it is applied first.
    `kube-system` and `kube-public` are never injected.

  - `consulNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces)) - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> These settings manage the connect injector's interaction with
    Consul namespaces (requires consul-ent v1.7+).
    Also, `global.enableConsulNamespaces` must be true.

    - `consulDestinationNamespace` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-consuldestinationnamespace)) (`string: default`) - Name of the Consul namespace to register all
      k8s pods into. If the Consul namespace does not already exist,
      it will be created. This will be ignored if `mirroringK8S` is true.

    - `mirroringK8S` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8s)) (`boolean: true`) - Causes k8s pods to be registered into a Consul namespace
      of the same name as their k8s namespace, optionally prefixed if
      `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set below. If the Consul namespace does not
      already exist, it will be created. Turning this on overrides the
      `consulDestinationNamespace` setting. If mirroring is enabled, avoid creating any Consul
      resources in the following Kubernetes namespaces, as Consul currently reserves these
      namespaces for system use: "system", "universal", "operator", "root".

    - `mirroringK8SPrefix` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8sprefix)) (`string: ""`) - If `mirroringK8S` is set to true, `mirroringK8SPrefix` allows each Consul namespace
      to be given a prefix. For example, if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set to "k8s-", a
      pod in the k8s `staging` namespace will be registered into the
      `k8s-staging` Consul namespace.

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-connectinject-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - Selector labels for connectInject pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.
    ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector

    Example:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `affinity` ((#v-connectinject-affinity)) (`string: null`) - Affinity Settings
    This should be a multi-line string matching the affinity object

  - `tolerations` ((#v-connectinject-tolerations)) (`string: null`) - Toleration Settings
    This should be a multi-line string matching the Toleration array
    in a PodSpec.

  - `aclBindingRuleSelector` ((#v-connectinject-aclbindingruleselector)) (`string: serviceaccount.name!=default`) - Query that defines which Service Accounts
    can authenticate to Consul and receive an ACL token during Connect injection.
    The default setting, i.e. serviceaccount.name!=default, prevents the
    'default' Service Account from logging in.
    If set to an empty string all service accounts can log in.
    This only has effect if ACLs are enabled.

    Refer to Auth methods [Binding rules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods#binding-rules)
    and [Trusted identiy attributes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/security/acl/auth-methods/kubernetes#trusted-identity-attributes)
    for more details.
    Requires Consul >= v1.5.

  - `overrideAuthMethodName` ((#v-connectinject-overrideauthmethodname)) (`string: ""`) - If you are not using global.acls.manageSystemACLs and instead manually setting up an
    auth method for Connect inject, set this to the name of your auth method.

  - `aclInjectToken` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken)) - Refers to a Kubernetes secret that you have created that contains
    an ACL token for your Consul cluster which allows the Connect injector the correct
    permissions. This is only needed if Consul namespaces <EnterpriseAlert inline /> and ACLs
    are enabled on the Consul cluster and you are not setting
    `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` to `true`.
    This token needs to have `operator = "write"` privileges to be able to
    create Consul namespaces.

    - `secretName` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Vault secret that holds the ACL inject token.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the Vault secret that holds the ACL inject token.

  - `sidecarProxy` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy))

    - `concurrency` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-concurrency)) (`string: 2`) - The number of worker threads to be used by the Envoy proxy.
      By default the threading model of Envoy will use one thread per CPU core per envoy proxy. This
      leads to unnecessary thread and memory usage and leaves unnecessary idle connections open. It is
      advised to keep this number low for sidecars and high for edge proxies.
      This will control the `--concurrency` flag to Envoy.
      For additional information, refer to https://blog.envoyproxy.io/envoy-threading-model-a8d44b922310

      This setting can be overridden on a per-pod basis via this annotation:
      - `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-envoy-proxy-concurrency`

    - `resources` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-resources)) (`map`) - Set default resources for sidecar proxy. If null, that resource won't

        - `cpu` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-resources-limits-cpu)) (`string: null`) - Recommended production default: 100m

    - `lifecycle` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-lifecycle)) (`map`) - Set default lifecycle management configuration for sidecar proxy.
      These settings can be overridden on a per-pod basis via these annotations:

      - `consul.hashicorp.com/enable-sidecar-proxy-lifecycle`
      - `consul.hashicorp.com/enable-sidecar-proxy-shutdown-drain-listeners`

      - `defaultGracefulPort` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-lifecycle-defaultgracefulport)) (`integer: 20600`)

      - `defaultGracefulShutdownPath` ((#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-lifecycle-defaultgracefulshutdownpath)) (`string: /graceful_shutdown`)

  - `initContainer` ((#v-connectinject-initcontainer)) (`map`) - The resource settings for the Connect injected init container. If null, the resources
    won't be set for the initContainer. The defaults are optimized for developer instances of
    Kubernetes, however they should be tweaked with the recommended defaults as shown below to speed up service registration times.

    - `resources` ((#v-connectinject-initcontainer-resources))

      - `requests` ((#v-connectinject-initcontainer-resources-requests))

        - `memory` ((#v-connectinject-initcontainer-resources-requests-memory)) (`string: 25Mi`) - Recommended production default: 150Mi

### meshGateway ((#h-meshgateway))

- `meshGateway` ((#v-meshgateway)) - [Mesh Gateways](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway) enable Consul Connect to work across Consul datacenters.

  - `enabled` ((#v-meshgateway-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If [mesh gateways](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway) are enabled, a Deployment will be created that runs
    gateways and Consul Connect will be configured to use gateways.
    This setting is required for [Cluster Peering](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/k8s).
    Requirements: consul 1.6.0+ if using `global.acls.manageSystemACLs``.

  - `replicas` ((#v-meshgateway-replicas)) (`integer: 1`) - Number of replicas for the Deployment.

  - `wanAddress` ((#v-meshgateway-wanaddress)) - What gets registered as WAN address for the gateway.

    - `source` ((#v-meshgateway-wanaddress-source)) (`string: Service`) - source configures where to retrieve the WAN address (and possibly port)
      for the mesh gateway from.
      Can be set to either: `Service`, `NodeIP`, `NodeName` or `Static`.

      - `Service` - Determine the address based on the service type.

        - If `service.type=LoadBalancer` use the external IP or hostname of
          the service. Use the port set by `service.port`.

        - If `service.type=NodePort` use the Node IP. The port will be set to
          `service.nodePort` so `service.nodePort` cannot be null.

        - If `service.type=ClusterIP` use the `ClusterIP`. The port will be set to
          `service.port`.

        - `service.type=ExternalName` is not supported.

      - `NodeIP` - The node IP as provided by the Kubernetes downward API.

      - `NodeName` - The name of the node as provided by the Kubernetes downward
        API. This is useful if the node names are DNS entries that
        are routable from other datacenters.

      - `Static` - Use the address hardcoded in `meshGateway.wanAddress.static`.

    - `port` ((#v-meshgateway-wanaddress-port)) (`integer: 443`) - Port that gets registered for WAN traffic.
      If source is set to "Service" then this setting will have no effect.
      Refer to the documentation for source as to which port will be used in that
      case.

    - `static` ((#v-meshgateway-wanaddress-static)) (`string: ""`) - If source is set to "Static" then this value will be used as the WAN
      address of the mesh gateways. This is useful if you've configured a
      DNS entry to point to your mesh gateways.

  - `service` ((#v-meshgateway-service)) - The service option configures the Service that fronts the Gateway Deployment.

    - `type` ((#v-meshgateway-service-type)) (`string: LoadBalancer`) - Type of service, ex. LoadBalancer, ClusterIP.

    - `port` ((#v-meshgateway-service-port)) (`integer: 443`) - Port that the service will be exposed on.
      The targetPort will be set to meshGateway.containerPort.

    - `nodePort` ((#v-meshgateway-service-nodeport)) (`integer: null`) - Optionally set the nodePort value of the service if using a NodePort service.
      If not set and using a NodePort service, Kubernetes will automatically assign
      a port.

    - `annotations` ((#v-meshgateway-service-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Annotations to apply to the mesh gateway service.

      Example:

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        'annotation-key': annotation-value
      ```

    - `additionalSpec` ((#v-meshgateway-service-additionalspec)) (`string: null`) - Optional YAML string that will be appended to the Service spec.

  - `hostNetwork` ((#v-meshgateway-hostnetwork)) (`boolean: false`) - If set to true, gateway Pods will run on the host network.

  - `dnsPolicy` ((#v-meshgateway-dnspolicy)) (`string: null`) - dnsPolicy to use.

  - `consulServiceName` ((#v-meshgateway-consulservicename)) (`string: mesh-gateway`) - Consul service name for the mesh gateways.
    Cannot be set to anything other than "mesh-gateway" if
    global.acls.manageSystemACLs is true since the ACL token
    generated is only for the name 'mesh-gateway'.

  - `containerPort` ((#v-meshgateway-containerport)) (`integer: 8443`) - Port that the gateway will run on inside the container.

  - `hostPort` ((#v-meshgateway-hostport)) (`integer: null`) - Optional hostPort for the gateway to be exposed on.
    This can be used with wanAddress.port and wanAddress.useNodeIP
    to expose the gateways directly from the node.
    If hostNetwork is true, this must be null or set to the same port as
    containerPort.
    NOTE: Cannot set to 8500 or 8502 because those are reserved for the Consul
    agent.

  - `serviceAccount` ((#v-meshgateway-serviceaccount))

    - `annotations` ((#v-meshgateway-serviceaccount-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional annotations for the mesh gateways' service account. This should be formatted as a
      multi-line string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

  - `resources` ((#v-meshgateway-resources)) (`map`) - The resource settings for mesh gateway pods.
    NOTE: The use of a YAML string is deprecated. Instead, set directly as a
    YAML map.

  - `initServiceInitContainer` ((#v-meshgateway-initserviceinitcontainer)) (`map`) - The resource settings for the `service-init` init container.

  - `affinity` ((#v-meshgateway-affinity)) (`string: null`) - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
    for mesh gateway pods. It defaults to `null` thereby allowing multiple gateway pods on each node. But if one would prefer
    a mode which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost, set this value
    to the value in the example below.

    Example:

    ```yaml
     affinity: |
       podAntiAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           - labelSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 app: {{ template "consul.name" . }}
                 release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
                 component: mesh-gateway
             topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    ```

  - `topologySpreadConstraints` ((#v-meshgateway-topologyspreadconstraints)) (`string: ""`) - Pod topology spread constraints for mesh gateway pods.
    This should be a multi-line YAML string matching the
    [`topologySpreadConstraints`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/)
    array in a Pod Spec.

    This requires K8S >= 1.18 (beta) or 1.19 (stable).

    Example:

    ```yaml
    topologySpreadConstraints: |
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{ template "consul.name" . }}
            release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
            component: mesh-gateway
    ```

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-meshgateway-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - Optional YAML string to specify a nodeSelector config.

        SRV record. If using a NodePort service type, you must specify the
        desired nodePort for each exposed port.

      - `annotations` ((#v-ingressgateways-defaults-service-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Annotations to apply to the ingress gateway service. Annotations defined
        here will be applied to all ingress gateway services in addition to any

## Helm Chart Examples

The below `values.yaml` results in a single server Consul cluster with a `LoadBalancer` to allow external access to the UI and API.

```yaml
# values.yaml
server:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapExpect: 1

ui:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

The below `values.yaml` results in a three server Consul Enterprise cluster with 100GB of storage and automatic Connect injection.

Note, this would require a secret that contains the enterprise license key.

```yaml
# values.yaml
global:
  image: 'hashicorp/consul-enterprise:1.4.2-ent'

server:
  replicas: 3
  bootstrapExpect: 3
  enterpriseLicense:
    secretName: 'consul-license'
    secretKey: 'key'
  storage: 100Gi
  connect: true

client:
  grpc: true

connectInject:
  enabled: true
  default: false
```

## Customizing the Helm Chart

Consul within Kubernetes is highly configurable and the Helm chart contains dozens
of the most commonly used configuration options.
If you need to extend the Helm chart with additional options, we recommend using a third-party tool,
such as [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) or [ship](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship).
Note that the Helm chart heavily relies on Helm lifecycle hooks, and so features like bootstrapping ACLs or TLS
will not work as expected. Additionally, we can make changes to the internal implementation (e.g., renaming template files) that
may be backward incompatible with such customizations.
