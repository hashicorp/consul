# Manage cluster peering connections on Kubernetes

This usage topic describes how to manage cluster peering connections on Kubernetes deployments.

After you establish a cluster peering connection, you can get a list of all active peering connections, read a specific peering connection's information, and delete peering connections.

For general guidance for managing cluster peering connections, refer to [Manage L7 traffic with cluster peering](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/usage/peering-traffic-management).

## Reset a peering connection

To reset the cluster peering connection, you need to generate a new peering token from the cluster where you created the `PeeringAcceptor` CRD. The only way to create or set a new peering token is to manually adjust the value of the annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/peering-version`. Creating a new token causes the previous token to expire.

1. In the `PeeringAcceptor` CRD, add the annotation `consul.hashicorp.com/peering-version`. If the annotation already exists, update its value to a higher version.

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="acceptor.yml" highlight="6" hideClipboard>

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
  kind: PeeringAcceptor
  metadata:
    name: cluster-02
    annotations:
      consul.hashicorp.com/peering-version: "1" ## The peering version you want to set, must be in quotes
  spec:
    peer:
      secret:
        name: "peering-token"
        key: "data"
        backend: "kubernetes"
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. After updating `PeeringAcceptor`, repeat all of the steps to [establish a new peering connection](/consul/docs/k8s/connect/cluster-peering/usage/establish-peering).

## List all peering connections

In Consul on Kubernetes deployments, you can list all active peering connections in a cluster using the Consul CLI.

1. If necessary, [configure your CLI to interact with the Consul cluster](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/kubernetes-gs-deploy#configure-your-cli-to-interact-with-consul-cluster).

1. Run the [`consul peering list` CLI command](/consul/commands/peering/list).

  ```shell-session
  $ consul peering list
  Name        State    Imported Svcs  Exported Svcs  Meta
  cluster-02  ACTIVE   0              2              env=production
  cluster-03  PENDING  0              0
  ```

## Read a peering connection

In Consul on Kubernetes deployments, you can get information about individual peering connections between clusters using the Consul CLI.

1. If necessary, [configure your CLI to interact with the Consul cluster](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/kubernetes-gs-deploy#configure-your-cli-to-interact-with-consul-cluster).

1. Run the [`consul peering read` CLI command](/consul/commands/peering/read).

  ```shell-session
  $ consul peering read -name cluster-02
  Name:         cluster-02
  ID:           3b001063-8079-b1a6-764c-738af5a39a97
  State:        ACTIVE
  Meta:
    env=production

  Peer ID:               e83a315c-027e-bcb1-7c0c-a46650904a05
  Peer Server Name:      server.dc1.consul
  Peer CA Pems:          0
  Peer Server Addresses:
    10.0.0.1:8300

  Imported Services: 0
  Exported Services: 2

  Create Index: 89
  Modify Index: 89
  ```

## Delete peering connections

To end a peering connection in Kubernetes deployments, delete both the `PeeringAcceptor` and `PeeringDialer` resources.

1. Delete the `PeeringDialer` resource from the second cluster.

  ```shell-session
  $ kubectl --context $CLUSTER2_CONTEXT delete --filename dialer.yaml
  ```

1. Delete the `PeeringAcceptor` resource from the first cluster.

  ```shell-session
  $ kubectl --context $CLUSTER1_CONTEXT delete --filename acceptor.yaml
  ````

To confirm that you deleted your peering connection in `cluster-01`, query the the `/health` HTTP endpoint:

1. Exec into the server pod for the first cluster.

  ```shell-session
  $ kubectl exec -it consul-server-0 --context $CLUSTER1_CONTEXT -- /bin/sh
  ```

1. If you've enabled ACLs, export an ACL token to access the `/health` HTP endpoint for services. The bootstrap token may be used if an ACL token is not already provisioned.

  ```shell-session
  $ export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=<INSERT BOOTSTRAP ACL TOKEN>
  ```

1. Query the the `/health` HTTP endpoint. Peered services with deleted connections should no longe appear.

  ```shell-session
  $ curl "localhost:8500/v1/health/connect/backend?peer=cluster-02"
  ```
