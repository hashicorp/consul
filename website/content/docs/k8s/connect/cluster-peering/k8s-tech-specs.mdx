# Cluster peering on Kubernetes technical specifications

This reference topic describes the technical specifications associated with using cluster peering in your Kubernetes deployments. These specifications include [required Helm values](#helm-requirements) and [required custom resource definitions (CRDs)](#crd-requirements), as well as required Consul components and their configurations.

For cluster peering requirements in other runtimes, refer to [cluster peering technical specifications](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/tech-specs).

## Helm requirements

 Mesh gateways are required when establishig cluster peering connections. The following values must be set in the Helm chart to enable mesh gateways:

- [`global.tls.enabled = true`](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-global-tls-enabled)
- [`meshGateway.enabled = true`](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-meshgateway-enabled)

Refer to the following example Helm configuration:

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

  ```yaml
    global:
      name: consul
      image: "hashicorp/consul:1.14.1"
      peering:
        enabled: true
      tls:
        enabled: true
    meshGateway:
      enabled: true
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

After mesh gateways are enabled in the Helm chart, you can separately [configure Mesh CRDs](#mesh-gateway-configuration-for-kubernetes).

## CRD requirements

You must create the following CRDs in order to establish a peering connection:

- `PeeringAcceptor`: Generates a peering token and accepts an incoming peering connection.
- `PeeringDialer`: Uses a peering token to make an outbound peering connection with the cluster that generated the token.

Refer to the following example CRDs:

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "PeeringAcceptor", "PeeringDialer" ]}>

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="acceptor.yaml">

  ```yaml
    apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
    kind: PeeringAcceptor
    metadata:
      name: cluster-02 ## The name of the peer you want to connect to
    spec:
      peer:
        secret:
          name: "peering-token"
          key: "data"
          backend: "kubernetes"
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

   <CodeBlockConfig filename="dialer.yaml">

  ```yaml
    apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
    kind: PeeringDialer
    metadata:
      name: cluster-01 ## The name of the peer you want to connect to
    spec:
      peer:
        secret:
          name: "peering-token"
          key: "data"
          backend: "kubernetes"
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>
  </CodeTabs>

## General Requirements

To use cluster peering features, make sure your Consul environment meets the following prerequisites:

- Consul v1.14 or higher.
- A local Consul agent is required to manage mesh gateway configuration.
- Use [Envoy proxies](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy). Envoy is the only proxy with mesh gateway capabilities in Consul.

In addition, the following service mesh components are required in order to establish cluster peering connections:
  
- [Mesh gateways](#mesh-gateway-requirements)
- [Sidecar proxies](#sidecar-proxy-requirements)
- [Exported services](#exported-service-requirements)
- [ACLs](#acl-requirements)

### Mesh gateway requirements

Mesh gateways are required for routing service mesh traffic between partitions with cluster peering connections. Consider the following general requirements for mesh gateways when using cluster peering:

- A cluster requires a registered mesh gateway in order to export services to peers.
- For Enterprise, this mesh gateway must also be registered in the same partition as the exported services and their `exported-services` configuration entry.
- To use the `local` mesh gateway mode, you must register a mesh gateway in the importing cluster.

In addition, you must define the `Proxy.Config` settings using opaque parameters compatible with your proxy. Refer to the [Gateway options](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#gateway-options) and [Escape-hatch Overrides](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#escape-hatch-overrides) documentation for additional Envoy proxy configuration information.

#### Mesh gateway modes

By default, all cluster peering connections use mesh gateways in [remote mode](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway/service-to-service-traffic-wan-datacenters#remote). Be aware of these additional requirements when changing a mesh gateway's mode.

- For mesh gateways that connect peered clusters, you can set the `mode` as either `remote` or `local`.
- The `none` mode is invalid for mesh gateways with cluster peering connections.

Refer to [mesh gateway modes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway#modes) for more information.

#### Mesh gateway configuration for Kubernetes

Mesh gateways are required for cluster peering connections. Complete the following steps to add mesh gateways to your deployment so that you can establish cluster peering connections:

1. In `cluster-01` create the `Mesh` custom resource with `peeringThroughMeshGateways` set to `true`.

    <CodeBlockConfig filename="mesh.yaml">

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Mesh
    metadata:
      name: mesh
    spec:
      peering:
        peerThroughMeshGateways: true
    ```

    </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Apply the mesh gateway to `cluster-01`.

    ```shell-session
    $  kubectl --context $CLUSTER1_CONTEXT apply -f mesh.yaml 
    ```

1. Repeat the process to create and apply a mesh gateway with cluster peering enabled to `cluster-02`:

    <CodeBlockConfig filename="mesh.yaml">

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Mesh
    metadata:
      name: mesh
    spec:
      peering:
        peerThroughMeshGateways: true
    ```

    </CodeBlockConfig>

    ```shell-session
    $  kubectl --context $CLUSTER2_CONTEXT apply -f mesh.yaml 
    ```

## Sidecar proxy requirements

The Envoy proxies that function as sidecars in your service mesh require configuration in order to properly route traffic to peers. Sidecar proxies are defined in the [service definition](/consul/docs/discovery/services).

- Configure the `proxy.upstreams` parameters to route traffic to the correct service, namespace, and peer. Refer to the [`upstreams` documentation](/consul/docs/connect/registration/service-registration#upstream-configuration-reference) for details.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_name` parameter is always required.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_peer` parameter must be configured to enable cross-cluster traffic.
- The `proxy.upstream/destination_namespace` configuration is only necessary if the destination service is in a non-default namespace.

## Exported service requirements

The `exported-services` configuration entry is required in order for services to communicate across partitions with cluster peering connections.

Basic guidance on using the `exported-services` configuration entry is included in [Establish cluster peering connections](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/usage/create-cluster-peering).

Refer to the [`exported-services` configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/exported-services) for more information.

## ACL requirements

If ACLs are enabled, you must add tokens to grant the following permissions:

- Grant `service:write` permissions to services that define mesh gateways in their server definition.
- Grant `service:read` permissions for all services on the partition.
- Grant `mesh:write` permissions to the mesh gateways that participate in cluster peering connections. This permission allows a leaf certificate to be issued for mesh gateways to terminate TLS sessions for HTTP requests.
