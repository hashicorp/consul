# Configure Ingress Gateways for Consul on Kubernetes

-> 1.9.0+: This feature is available in Consul versions 1.9.0 and higher

~> This topic requires familiarity with [Ingress Gateways](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/ingress-gateway).

This page describes how to enable external access through Consul ingress gateways to mesh services running inside Kubernetes.
See [Ingress Gateways](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/ingress-gateway) for more information on use-cases and how it works.

Adding an ingress gateway is a multi-step process that consists of the following steps:

- Setting the Helm chart configuration
- Deploying the Helm chart
- Configuring the gateway
- Defining an Intention (if ACLs are enabled)
- Deploying your application to Kubernetes
- Connecting to your application

## Setting the helm chart configuration

When deploying the Helm chart you must provide Helm with a custom YAML file that contains your environment configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  name: consul
connectInject:
  enabled: true
ingressGateways:
  enabled: true
  gateways:
    - name: ingress-gateway
      service:
        type: LoadBalancer
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

~> **Note:** this will create a public unauthenticated LoadBalancer in your cluster, please take appropriate security considerations.

The YAML snippet is the launching point for a valid configuration that must be supplied when installing using the [official consul-helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/hashicorp/consul).
Information on additional options can be found in the [Helm reference](/consul/docs/k8s/helm).
Configuration options for ingress gateways reside under the [ingressGateways](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-ingressgateways) entry.

The gateways stanza is where you will define and configure the set of ingress gateways you want deployed to your environment.
The only required field for each entry is `name`, though entries may contain any of the fields found in the `defaults` stanza.
Values in this section override the values from the defaults stanza for the given ingress gateway with one exception:
the annotations from the defaults stanza will be _appended_ to any user-defined annotations defined in the gateways stanza rather than being overridden.
Please refer to the ingress gateway configuration [documentation](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-ingressgateways-defaults) for a detailed explanation of each option.

## Deploying the Helm chart

Ensure you have the latest consul-helm chart and install Consul via helm using the following
[guide](/consul/docs/k8s/installation/install#installing-consul) while being sure to provide the yaml configuration
as previously discussed.

## Configuring the gateway

Now that Consul has been installed with ingress gateways enabled,
you can configure the gateways via the [`IngressGateway`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/ingress-gateway) custom resource.

Here is an example `IngressGateway` resource:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="ingress-gateway.yaml">

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: IngressGateway
metadata:
  name: ingress-gateway
spec:
  listeners:
    - port: 8080
      protocol: http
      services:
        - name: static-server
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

~> **Note:** The 'name' field for the IngressGateway resource must match the name
specified when creating the gateway in the Helm chart. In the above example, the
name "ingress-gateway" is the [default name](/consul/docs/k8s/helm#v-ingressgateways-gateways-name)
used by the Helm chart when enabling ingress gateways.

Apply the `IngressGateway` resource with `kubectl apply`:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --filename ingress-gateway.yaml
ingressgateway.consul.hashicorp.com/ingress-gateway created
```

Since we're using `protocol: http`, we also need to set the protocol of our service
`static-server` to http. To do that, we create a [`ServiceDefaults`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-defaults) custom resource:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="service-defaults.yaml">

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: static-server
spec:
  protocol: http
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Apply the `ServiceDefaults` resource with `kubectl apply`:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --filename service-defaults.yaml
servicedefaults.consul.hashicorp.com/static-server created
```

Ensure both resources have synced to Consul successfully:

```shell-session
$ kubectl get servicedefaults
NAME            SYNCED   AGE
static-server   True     45s

$ kubectl get ingressgateway
NAME              SYNCED   AGE
ingress-gateway   True     13m
```

### Viewing the UI

You can confirm the ingress gateways have been configured as expected by viewing the ingress-gateway service instances
in the Consul UI.

To view the UI, use the `kubectl port-forward` command. See [Viewing The Consul UI](/consul/docs/k8s/installation/install#viewing-the-consul-ui)
for full instructions.

Once you've port-forwarded to the UI, navigate to the Ingress Gateway instances: [http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services/ingress-gateway/instances](http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services/ingress-gateway/instances)

If TLS is enabled, use [https://localhost:8501/ui/dc1/services/ingress-gateway/instances](https://localhost:8501/ui/dc1/services/ingress-gateway/instances).

## Defining an Intention

If ACLs are enabled (via the `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` setting), you must define an [intention](/consul/docs/connect/intentions)
to allow the ingress gateway to route to the upstream services defined in the `IngressGateway` resource (in the example above the upstream service is `static-server`).

To create an intention that allows the ingress gateway to route to the service `static-server`, create a [`ServiceIntentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions)
resource:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="service-intentions.yaml">

```yaml
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceIntentions
metadata:
  name: static-server
spec:
  destination:
    name: static-server
  sources:
    - name: ingress-gateway
      action: allow
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Apply the `ServiceIntentions` resource with `kubectl apply`:

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --filename service-intentions.yaml
serviceintentions.consul.hashicorp.com/ingress-gateway created
```

For detailed instructions on how to configure zero-trust networking with intentions please refer to this [guide](/consul/tutorials/kubernetes-features/service-mesh-zero-trust-network?utm_source=docs).

## Deploying your application to Kubernetes

Now you will deploy a sample application which echoes "hello world"

<CodeBlockConfig filename="static-server.yaml">

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: static-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: static-server
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: static-server
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: static-server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: static-server
  template:
    metadata:
      name: static-server
      labels:
        app: static-server
      annotations:
        'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: static-server
          image: hashicorp/http-echo:latest
          args:
            - -text="hello world"
            - -listen=:8080
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
      serviceAccountName: static-server
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply --filename static-server.yaml
```

## Connecting to your application

You can validate the service is running and registered in the Consul UI by navigating to
[http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services/static-server/instances](http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/services/static-server/instances)

If TLS is enabled, use: [https://localhost:8501/ui/dc1/services/static-server/instances](https://localhost:8501/ui/dc1/services/static-server/instances)

You can also validate the connectivity of the application from the ingress gateway using `curl`:

```shell-session
$ EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get services --selector component=ingress-gateway --output jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{@.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}{end}")
$ echo "Connecting to \"$EXTERNAL_IP\""
$ curl --header "Host: static-server.ingress.consul" "http://$EXTERNAL_IP:8080"
"hello world"
```

~> **Security Warning:** Please be sure to delete the application and services created here as they represent a security risk through
leaving an open and unauthenticated load balancer alive in your cluster.

To delete the ingress gateway, set enabled to `false` in your Helm configuration:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml" highlight="8">

```yaml
global:
  name: consul
connectInject:
  enabled: true
ingressGateways:
  enabled: false # Set to false
  gateways:
    - name: ingress-gateway
      service:
        type: LoadBalancer
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

And run Helm upgrade:

```shell-session
$ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --values values.yaml
```
