# Consul on Kubernetes Version Compatibility

For every release of Consul on Kubernetes, a Helm chart, `consul-k8s-control-plane` binary and a `consul-k8s` CLI binary is built and distributed through a single version. When deploying via Helm, the recommended best path for upgrading Consul on Kubernetes, is to upgrade using the same `consul-k8s-control-plane` version as the Helm Chart, as the Helm Chart and Control Plane binary are tightly coupled.

## Supported Consul and Kubernetes versions

Consul Kubernetes versions all of its components (`consul-k8s` CLI, `consul-k8s-control-plane`, and Helm chart) with a single semantic version. When installing or upgrading to a specific versions, ensure that you are using the correct Consul version with the compatible `consul-k8s` helm chart and/or CLI.

| Consul Version | Compatible consul-k8s Versions   | Compatible Kubernetes Versions | 
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------|
| 1.16.x         | 1.2.x                            | 1.24.x - 1.27.x                |
| 1.15.x         | 1.1.x                            | 1.23.x - 1.26.x                |
| 1.14.x         | 1.0.x                            | 1.22.x - 1.25.x                |

## Supported Envoy versions

Supported versions of Envoy and `consul-dataplane` (for Consul K8s 1.0 and above) for Consul versions are also found in [Envoy - Supported Versions](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions). Starting with `consul-k8s` 1.0, `consul-dataplane` will include a bundled version of Envoy. The recommended best practice is to use the default version of Envoy or `consul-dataplane` that is provided in the Helm `values.yaml` file, as that is the version that has been tested with the default Consul and Consul Kubernetes binaries for a given Helm chart.

## Vault as a Secrets Backend compatibility

Starting with Consul K8s 0.39.0 and Consul 1.11.x, Consul Kubernetes supports the ability to utilize Vault as the secrets backend for all the secrets utilized by Consul on Kubernetes.

| `consul-k8s` Versions    | Compatible Vault Versions | Compatible `vault-k8s` Versions |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------| ----------------------------- |
| 0.39.0 - latest          | 1.9.0 - latest            | 0.14.0 - latest               |
