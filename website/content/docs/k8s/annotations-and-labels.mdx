# Annotations and Labels

## Overview

Consul on Kubernetes provides a few options for customizing how connect-inject behavior should be configured.
This allows the user to configure natively configure Consul on select Kubernetes resources (i.e. pods, services).

- [Annotations](#annotations)
- [Labels](#labels)

## Annotations

Resource annotations could be used on the Kubernetes pod to control connect-inject behavior.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject` - If this is "true" then injection
  is enabled. If this is "false" then injection is explicitly disabled.
  The default injector behavior requires pods to opt-in to injection by
  specifying this value as "true". This default can be changed in the
  injector's configuration if desired.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy` - If this is "true", this Pod
  will run with transparent proxy enabled. This means you can use Kubernetes
  DNS to access upstream services and all inbound and outbound traffic within
  the pod is redirected to go through the proxy.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-overwrite-probes` - If this is "true"
  and transparent proxy is enabled, the Connect injector will overwrite Kubernetes
  HTTP probes to point to the Envoy proxy.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-inbound-ports` - A comma-separated
  list of inbound ports to exclude from traffic redirection when running in transparent proxy
  mode.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-outbound-cidrs` - A comma-separated
  list of outbound CIDRs to exclude from traffic redirection when running in transparent proxy
  mode.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-outbound-ports` - A comma-separated
  list of outbound ports to exclude from traffic redirection when running in transparent proxy
  mode.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/transparent-proxy-exclude-uids` - A comma-separated
  list of additional user IDs to exclude from traffic redirection when running in transparent proxy
  mode.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service` - For pods that accept inbound
  connections, this specifies the name of the service that is being
  served. This defaults to the name of the Kubernetes service associated with the pod.

  If using ACLs, this must be the same name as the Pod's `ServiceAccount`.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-port` - For pods that accept inbound
  connections, this specifies the port to route inbound connections to. This
  is the port that the service is listening on. The service port defaults to
  the first exposed port on any container in the pod. If specified, the value
  can be the _name_ of a configured port, such as "http" or it can be a direct
  port value such as "8080". This is the port of the _service_, the proxy
  public listener will listen on a dynamic port.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams` - The list of upstream
  services that this pod needs to connect to via Connect along with a static
  local port to listen for those connections. When transparent proxy is enabled,
  this annotation is optional.

  - Services

    The name of the service is the name of the service registered with Consul. You can optionally specify datacenters with this annotation.

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

  - Consul Enterprise Namespaces

    If running Consul Enterprise 1.7+, your upstream services may be running in different
    namespaces. The upstream namespace can be specified after the service name
    as `[service-name].[namespace]`. See [Consul Enterprise Namespaces](#consul-enterprise-namespaces)
    below for more details on configuring the injector.

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name].[service-namespace]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

    -> **NOTE:** If the namespace is not specified it will default to the namespace
    of the source service.

    ~> **WARNING:** Setting a namespace when not using Consul Enterprise or using a version < 1.7
    is not supported. It will be treated as part of the service name.

  - [Prepared Query](/docs/connect/proxies#dynamic-upstreams-require-native-integration)

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams': 'prepared_query:[query name]:[port]'
    ```

  - Multiple Upstreams

    If you would like to specify multiple services or upstreams, delimit them with commas

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter],[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter],prepared_query:[query name]:[port]"
    ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/envoy-extra-args` - A space-separated list of [arguments](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/cli)
  to be passed to the injected envoy binary.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/envoy-extra-args: '--log-level debug --disable-hot-restart'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/kubernetes-service` - Specifies the name of the Kubernetes service used for Consul service registration.
  This is useful when multiple Kubernetes services reference the same deployment. Any service that does not match the name
  specified in this annotation is ignored. When not specified no service is ignored.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/kubernetes-service: 'service-name-to-use'
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags` - A comma separated list of tags that will
  be applied to the Consul service and its sidecar.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags: foo,bar,baz
  ```

  If you need your tag to have a comma in it you can escape the comma with `\,`. For example,
  `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags: foo\,bar\,baz` will become the single tag `foo,bar,baz`.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-<YOUR_KEY>` - Set Consul meta key/value
  pairs that will be applied to the Consul service and its sidecar.
  The key will be what comes after `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-`, e.g.
  `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-foo: bar` will result in `foo: bar`.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-foo: baz
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-bar: baz
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-` - Override default resource settings for
  the sidecar proxy container.
  The defaults are set in Helm config via the [`connectInject.sidecarProxy.resources`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-resources) key.

  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-cpu-limit` - Override the default CPU limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-cpu-request` - Override the default CPU request.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-memory-limit` - Override the default memory limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-memory-request` - Override the default memory request.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-envoy-proxy-concurrency` - Override the default envoy worker thread count. This should be set low for sidecar
  usecases and can be raised for edge proxies like gateways.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-sidecar-` - Override default resource settings for
  the `consul-sidecar` container.
  The defaults are set in Helm config via the [`global.consulSidecarContainer.resources`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-global-consulsidecarcontainer) key.

  - `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-sidecar-cpu-limit` - Override the default CPU limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-sidecar-cpu-request` - Override the default CPU request.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-sidecar-memory-limit` - Override the default memory limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/consul-sidecar-memory-request` - Override the default memory request.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/enable-metrics` - Override the default Helm value [`connectInject.metrics.defaultEnabled`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultenabled).
- `consul.hashicorp.com/enable-metrics-merging` - Override the default Helm value [`connectInject.metrics.defaultEnableMerging`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultenablemerging).
- `consul.hashicorp.com/merged-metrics-port` - Override the default Helm value [`connectInject.metrics.defaultMergedMetricsPort`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultmergedmetricsport).
- `consul.hashicorp.com/prometheus-scrape-port` - Override the default Helm value [`connectInject.metrics.defaultPrometheusScrapePort`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultprometheusscrapeport).
- `consul.hashicorp.com/prometheus-scrape-path` - Override the default Helm value [`connectInject.metrics.defaultPrometheusScrapePath`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-metrics-defaultprometheusscrapepath).
- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-metrics-port` - Set the port where the Connect service exposes metrics.
- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-metrics-path` - Set the path where the Connect service exposes metrics.
- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject-mount-volume` - Comma separated list of container names to mount the connect-inject volume into. The volume will be mounted at `/consul/connect-inject`. The connect-inject volume contains Consul internals data needed by the other sidecar containers, for example the `consul` binary, and the Pod's Consul ACL token. This data can be valuable for advanced use-cases, such as making requests to the Consul API from within application containers.

## Labels

Resource labels could be used on a Kubernetes service to control connect-inject behavior.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-ignore` - This label can be set on a Kubernetes Service.
  If set to "true", the service will not be used to register a Consul endpoint. This can be
  useful in cases where 2 or more services point to the same deployment. Consul cannot register
  multiple endpoints to the same deployment. This label can be used to tell the endpoint
  registration to ignore all services except for the one which should be used for routing requests
  using Consul.
