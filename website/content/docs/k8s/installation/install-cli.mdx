# Install Consul on K8s CLI

# Install Consul on Kubernetes from Consul K8s CLI

This topic describes how to install Consul on Kubernetes using the Consul K8s CLI tool. The Consul K8s CLI tool enables you to quickly install and interact with Consul on Kubernetes. Use the Consul K8s CLI tool to install Consul on Kubernetes if you are deploying a single cluster. We recommend using the [Helm chart installation method](/docs/k8s/installation/install) if you are installing Consul on Kubernetes for multi-cluster deployments that involve cross-partition or cross datacenter communication.


## Introduction

If it is your first time installing Consul on Kubernetes, then you must first install the Consul K8s CLI tool. You can install Consul on Kubernetes using the Consul K8s tool after installing the CLI.

## Requirements

- The `kubectl` client must already be configured to authenticate to the Kubernetes cluster using a valid `kubeconfig` file.
- Install one of the following package managers so that you can install the Consul K8s CLI tool. The installation instructions also provide commands for installing and using the package managers:
   - MacOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
   - Ubuntu/Debian: apt
   - CentOS/RHEL: yum

You must install the correct version of the CLI for your Consul on Kubernetes deployment. To deploy a previous version of Consul on Kubernetes, download the specific version of the CLI that matches the version of the control plane that you would like to deploy. Refer to the [compatibility matrix](/docs/k8s/compatibility) for details.


## Install the CLI

The following instructions describe how to install the latest version of the Consul K8s CLI tool, as well as earlier versions, so that you can install an appropriate version of tool for your control plane.

### Install the latest version

Complete the following instructions for a fresh installation of Consul on Kubernetes.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="MacOS">

The [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager is required to complete the following installation instructions. The Homebrew formulae always installs the latest version of a binary.

1. Install the HashiCorp `tap`, which is a repository of all Homebrew packages for HashiCorp:
    ```shell-session
    $ brew tap hashicorp/tap
    ```

1. Install the Consul K8s CLI with `hashicorp/tap/consul` formula.
    ```shell-session
    $ brew install hashicorp/tap/consul-k8s
    ```

1. If you have already provisioned a Kubernetes cluster and have already configured access to the cluster via a `kubeconfig` file, you are ready to install Consul K8s. Issue the `install` subcommand to install Consul on Kubernetes:

    ```shell-session
    $ consul-k8s install <OPTIONS>
    ```

1. (Optional) Issue the `consul-k8s version` command to verify the installation:

   ```shell-session
   $ consul-k8s version
       consul-k8s 1.0.2
   ```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Linux - Ubuntu/Debian">

1. Add the HashiCorp GPG key.

   ```shell-session
   $ curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

1. Add the HashiCorp apt repository.

   ```shell-session
   $ sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   ```

1. Run apt-get install to install the `consul-k8s` CLI.

   ```shell-session
   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install consul-k8s
   ```

1. (Optional) Issue the `consul-k8s version` command to verify the installation.

   ```shell-session
   $ consul-k8s version
       consul-k8s 1.0.2
   ```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Linux - CentOS/RHEL">

1. Install `yum-config-manager` to manage your repositories.

    ```shell-session
    $ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
    ```

1. Use `yum-config-manager` to add the official HashiCorp Linux repository.

    ```shell-session
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
    ```

1. Install the `consul-k8s` CLI.

    ```shell-session
    $ sudo yum -y install consul-k8s
    ```

1. (Optional) Issue the `consul-k8s version` command to verify the installation.

   ```shell-session
   $ consul-k8s version
       consul-k8s 1.0.2
   ```

### Install a previous version

Complete the following instructions to install a specific version of the CLI so that your tool is compatible with your Consul on Kubernetes control plane. Refer to the [compatibility matrix](/docs/k8s/compatibility) for additional information.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="MacOS">

1. Download the appropriate version of Consul K8s CLI using the following `curl` command. Set the `$VERSION` environment variable to the appropriate version for your deployment.

   ```shell-session
   $ export VERSION=0.49.0 && \
       curl -L "https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-k8s/${VERSION}/consul-k8s_${VERSION}_darwin_$( [ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && echo arm64 || echo amd64).zip" -o consul-k8s-cli.zip
   ```

1. Unzip the zip file output to extract the `consul-k8s` CLI binary. This overwrites existing files and also creates a `.consul-k8s` subdirectory in your `$HOME` folder.

   ```shell-session
   $ unzip -o consul-k8s-cli.zip -d ~/.consul-k8s
   ```

1. Add the path to your directory. In order to persist the `$PATH` across sessions, dd it to your shellrc (i.e. shell run commands) file for the shell used by your terminal.

   ```shell-session
   $ export PATH=$HOME/.consul-k8s/:$PATH
   ```

1. (Optional) Issue the `consul-k8s version` command to verify the installation.

   ```shell-session
   $ consul-k8s version
       consul-k8s 0.49.0
   ```

## Install Consul on Kubernetes

After installing the Consul K8s CLI tool (`consul-k8s`), issue the `install` subcommand and any additional options to install Consul on Kubernetes. 
Refer to the [Consul K8s CLI reference](/docs/k8s/k8s-cli) for details about all commands and available options. 
If you do not include any additional options, the `consul-k8s` CLI installs Consul on Kubernetes using the default settings form the Consul Helm chart values.
The following example installs Consul on Kubernetes with Service Mesh and CRDs enabled with the `quickstart` preset. If you are using `consul-k8s` < 1.0.0 use the `demo` preset instead.

```shell-session
$ consul-k8s install --preset quickstart

You can include the `-auto-approve` option set to `true` to proceed with the installation if the pre-install checks pass.

The pre-install checks may fail if existing `PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVC) are detected. Refer to the [uninstall instructions](/docs/k8s/operations/uninstall#uninstall-consul) for information about removing PVCs.

## Check the Consul cluster status

Issue the `consul-k8s status` command to view the status of the installed Consul cluster.

```shell-session
