# Storing Gossip Encryption Key in Vault

## Pre-requisites
Prior to setting up data integration between Vault and Consul on Kubernetes, you will need to have:  
1. Read and completed the steps in the [Systems Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/docs/k8s/installation/vault).
2. Read the [Data Integration Overview](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/docs/k8s/installation/vault).

## Overview
To use a gossip encryption key stored in Vault, we will follow the steps outlined in the [Data Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/data-integration):

- One time set up in Vault
  1. Store the secret in Vault.
  1. Create a Vault policy that authorizes the desired level of access to the secret.
- Set up per Consul data center
  1. Create a Vault Kubernetes auth roles that link the policy to each Consul on Kubernetes service account that requires access.
  1. Configure the Vault Kubernetes auth role in the Consul on Kubernetes helm chart..

## One time set up in Vault
### Store the Secret in Vault
First, generate and store the gossip key in Vault:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put secret/consul/gossip key="$(consul keygen)"
```
### Create a Vault policy that authorizes the desired level of access to the secret
Next, we will need to create a policy that allows read access to this secret:


<CodeBlockConfig filename="gossip-policy.hcl">

```HCL
path "secret/data/consul/gossip" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

```shell-session
$ vault policy write gossip-policy gossip-policy.hcl
```

## Set up per Consul data center
### Create a Vault Kubernetes auth roles that link the policy to each Consul on Kubernetes service account that requires access
Next, we will create Kubernetes auth roles for the Consul server and client:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/consul-server \
    bound_service_account_names=<Consul server service account> \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=<Consul installation namespace> \
    policies=gossip-policy \
    ttl=1h
```

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/consul-client \
    bound_service_account_names=<Consul client service account> \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=<Consul installation namespace> \
    policies=gossip-policy \
    ttl=1h
```

To find out the service account names of the Consul server and client,
you can run the following `helm template` commands with your Consul on Kubernetes values file:

- Generate Consul server service account name
  ```shell-session
  $ helm template --release-name ${RELEASE_NAME} -s templates/server-serviceaccount.yaml hashicorp/consul
  ```

- Generate Consul client service account name
  ```shell-session
  $ helm template --release-name ${RELEASE_NAME} -s templates/client-serviceaccount.yaml hashicorp/consul
  ```

## Configure the Vault Kubernetes auth role in the Consul on Kubernetes helm chart

Now that we've configured Vault, you can configure the Consul Helm chart to
use the gossip key in Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  secretsBackend:
    vault:
      enabled: true
      consulServerRole: consul-server
      consulClientRole: consul-client
  gossipEncryption:
    secretName: secret/data/consul/gossip
    secretKey: key
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Note that `global.gossipEncryption.secretName` is the path of the secret in Vault.
This should be the same path as the one you'd include in your Vault policy.
`global.gossipEncryption.secretKey` is the key inside the secret data. This should be the same
as the key we passed when we created the gossip secret in Vault.
