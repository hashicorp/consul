page_title: Vault as Secrets Backend Data Integration Overview
description: >-
  Overview of the system integration aspects to using Vault as secrets backend for Consul on Kubernetes.
---

By default, Consul Helm chart will expect that any credentials it needs are stored as Kubernetes secrets.
As of Consul 1.11 and Consul Helm chart v0.38.0, we integrate more natively with Vault making it easier
to use Consul Helm chart with Vault as the secrets storage backend.

The following data points can be integrated and stored inVault:
- **Bootstrap token** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **Gossip encryption key** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **Enterprise license** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **Replication Token** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **Snapshot Agent Config** - The encryption key for gossip communication is stored in Vault.
- **TLS certificates and keys**:
  - **Consul Server TLS credentials** - TLS certificate and key for the Consul server is stored in Vault and issued from Vault.
  - **Service Mesh and Consul client TLS credentials** - Consul uses Vault as the provider for mTLS certificates and keys for the service mesh services
  and TLS certificates and keys for the Consul clients.
