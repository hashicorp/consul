# Storing the ACL Bootstrap Token in Vault

## Pre-requisites
Prior to setting up the data integration between Vault and Consul on Kubernetes, you will need to have:  
1. Read and completed the steps in the [Systems Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/docs/k8s/installation/vault).
2. Read the [Data Integration Overview](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration) section of [Vault as a Secrets Backend](/docs/k8s/installation/vault).

## Overview
To use an ACL bootstrap token stored in Vault, we will follow the steps outlined in the [Data Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/data-integration) section:

- One time set up in Vault
  1. Store the secret in Vault.
  1. Create a Vault policy that authorizes the desired level of access to the secret.
- Set up per Consul datacenter
  1. Create Vault Kubernetes auth roles that link the policy to each Consul on Kubernetes service account that requires access.
  1. Configure the Vault Kubernetes auth role in the Consul on Kubernetes helm chart.

## One time set up in Vault
### Store the Secret in Vault

First, store the ACL bootstrap token in Vault:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put secret/consul/boostrap-token token="<ACL bootstrap Token>"
```

### Create a Vault policy that authorizes the desired level of access to the secret
Next, you will need to create a policy that allows read access to this secret:


<CodeBlockConfig filename="bootstrap-token-policy.hcl">

```HCL
path "secret/data/consul/boostrap-token" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

```shell-session
$ vault policy write boostrap-token-policy boostrap-token-policy.hcl
```

-> **Note:** The secret path referenced by the above Policy will be your `global.acls.bootstrapToken.secretName` Helm value.

## Set up per Consul datacenter
### Create Vault Kubernetes auth roles that link the policy to each Consul on Kubernetes service account that requires access

Next, you will create Kubernetes auth roles for the Consul `server-acl-init` container that runs as part of the Consul server statefulset:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/consul-server-acl-init \
    bound_service_account_names=<Consul server service account> \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=<Consul installation namespace> \
    policies=boostrap-token-policy \
    ttl=1h
```

To find out the service account name of the Consul server-acl-init job,
you can run the following `helm template` command with your Consul on Kubernetes values file:

- Generate Consul server service account name
  ```shell-session
  $ helm template --release-name ${RELEASE_NAME} -s templates/server-acl-init-serviceaccount.yaml hashicorp/consul
  ```

### Configure the Vault Kubernetes auth role in the Consul on Kubernetes helm chart

Now that you have configured Vault, you can configure the Consul Helm chart to
use the  ACL bootrap token in Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

```yaml
global:
  secretsBackend:
    vault:
      enabled: true
      manageSystemACLsRole: consul-server-acl-init
  acls:
    bootstrapToken:
      secretName: secret/data/consul/bootstrap-token
      secretKey: token
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Note that `global.acls.bootstrapToken.secretName` is the path of the secret in Vault.
This should be the same path as the one you included in your Vault policy.
`global.acls.bootstrapToken.secretKey` is the key inside the secret data. This should be the same
as the key you passed when creating the  ACL replication token secret in Vault.
