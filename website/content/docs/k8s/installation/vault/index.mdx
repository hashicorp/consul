# Vault as Secrets Backend Overview

By default, Consul Helm chart will expect that any credentials it needs are stored as Kubernetes secrets.
As of Consul 1.11 and Consul Helm chart v0.38.0, we integrate more natively with Vault making it easier
to use Consul Helm chart with Vault as the secrets storage backend.

The following secrets can be stored in Vault KV secrets engine, which is meant to handle arbitraty secrets:
- Bootstrap token
- Gossip encryption key
- Enterprise license
- Replication token
- Snapshot Agent config

The following TLS certificates and keys can generated and managed by Vault the Vault PKI Engine, which is meant to handle things like certificate expiration and rotation:
- Consul Server TLS credentials
- Service Mesh and Consul client TLS credentials

## Requirements

1. Vault 1.9+ and Vault-k8s 0.14+ is required.
1. Vault must be installed and accessible to the Consul on Kubernetes installation.
1. `global.tls.enableAutoencrypt=true` is required if TLS is enabled for the Consul installation when using the Vault secrets backend.
1. The Vault installation must have been initialized, unsealed and the KV2 and PKI secrets engines enabled and the Kubernetes Auth Method enabled.
## Next Steps

The Vault integration with Consul on Kubernetes has two aspects or phases:
- [Systems Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration)
- [Data Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/data-integration) 

As a next step, please proceed to Vault integration with Consul on Kubernetes' [Systems Integration](/docs/k8s/installation/vault/systems-integration).
