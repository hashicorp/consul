# Deploy API gateway listeners to virtual machines

This topic describes how to deploy Consul API gateway listeners to networks that operate in virtual machine (VM) environments. If you want to implement API gateway listeners in a Kubernetes environment, refer to [Deploy API gateway listeners to Kubernetes](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/listener).

## Overview

API gateways have one or more listeners that serve as ingress points for requests to services in a Consul service mesh. Create an [API gateway configuration entry](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/api-gateway) and define listeners that expose ports on the endpoint for ingress.

The following steps describe the general workflow for deploying a Consul API gateway to a VM environment:

1. Create an API gateway configuration entry. The configuration entry includes listener configurations and references to TLS certificates.
1. Deploy the API gateway configuration entry to create the listeners.

### Encryption

To encrypt traffic between the external client and the service that the API gateway routes traffic to, define an inline certificate configuration and attach it to your listeners. Refer to [Encrypt API gateway traffic on virtual machines](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/secure-traffic/encrypt) for additional information.

### Routes

After deploying the gateway, attach [HTTP](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/http-route) routes and [TCP](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/tcp-route) routes to listeners defined in the gateway to control how requests route to services in the network. Refer to [Define API gateway routes on VMs](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/vm/route) for additional information.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be satisfied to use API gateways on VMs:

- Consul 1.15 or later
- A Consul cluster with service mesh enabled. Refer to [`connect`](//consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/service-mesh#connect)
- Network connectivity between the machine deploying the API Gateway and a
  Consul cluster agent or server

### ACL requirements

If ACLs are enabled, you must present a token with the following permissions to
configure Consul and deploy API gateways:

- `mesh: read`
- `mesh: write`

Refer to [Mesh Rules](/consul/docs/security/acl/acl-rules#mesh-rules) for
additional information about configuring policies that enable you to interact
with Consul API gateway configurations.

## Define the gateway and listeners

Create an API gateway configuration entry that defines listeners and TLS certificates
in the mesh.

1. Specify the following fields:
	- `Kind`: Specifies the type of configuration entry to implement. This must be `api-gateway`.
  	- `Name`:  Specify a name for the gateway configuration. The name is metadata that you can use to reference the configuration entry when performing Consul operations.
	- `Listeners`: Specify a list of listener configurations. Each listener is map containing the following fields:
    	- `Port`: Specifies the port that the listener receives traffic on.
		- `Name`: Specifies a unique name for the listener.
		- `Protocol`: You can set either `tcp` or `http`
		- `TLS`: Defines TLS encryption configurations for the listener.

	Refer to the [API gateway configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/api-gateway) for details on how to define fields in the `Listeners` block.
1. Configure any additional fields necessary for your use case, such as the namespace or admin partition. Refer to the [API gateway configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/api-gateway) for additional information.
1. Save the configuration.

In the following example, the API gateway specifies an HTTP listener on port `8443`. It also requires an inline-certificate configuration entry named `my-certificate` that contains a valid certificate and private key pair:

```hcl
Kind = "api-gateway"
Name = "my-gateway"

// Each listener configures a port which can be used to access the Consul cluster
Listeners = [
	{
		Port = 8443
		Name = "my-http-listener"
		Protocol = "http"
		TLS = {
			Certificates = [
				{
					Kind = "inline-certificate"
					Name = "my-certificate"
				}
			]
		}
	}
]
```

Refer to [API Gateway Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/api-gateway) for
information about all configuration fields.

Gateways and routes are eventually-consistent objects that provide feedback
about their current state through a series of status conditions. As a result,
you must manually check the route status to determine if the route
bound to the gateway successfully.

## Deploy the API gateway and listeners

Use the `consul config write` command to implement the API gateway configuration entry. The following command applies the configuration entry for the main gateway object:

```shell-session
$ consul config write gateways.hcl
```

Run the following command to deploy an API gateway instance:

```shell-session
$ consul connect envoy -gateway api -register -service my-api-gateway
```

The command directs Consul to configure Envoy as an API gateway. Gateways and routes are eventually-consistent objects that provide feedback about their current state through a series of status conditions. As a result, you must manually check the route status to determine if the route successfully bound to the gateway successfully.
