# Secure network access north/south

This topic provides an overview of the Consul components that securely allow systems outside the service mesh to access services inside the mesh. Network traffic that connects services inside the mesh to external clients or services is referred to as _north-south traffic_.

For information about intra-mesh, or _east-west traffic_ in your service mesh, refer to [Expand network east/west overview](/consul/docs/east-west).

## Introduction

You can define points of ingress to the service mesh using either API gateways or ingress gateways. These gateways allow external network clients to access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter.

API gateways forward requests from clients to specific destinations based on path or request protocol. Ingress gateways are Consul's legacy capability for ingress. We recommend using API gateways instead of ingress gateways.
