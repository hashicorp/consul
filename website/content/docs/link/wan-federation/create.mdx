# Create and manage federation connections

One of the key features of Consul is its support for multiple datacenters.
The architecture of Consul is designed to promote a low coupling of datacenters 
so that connectivity issues or failure of any datacenter does not impact the 
availability of Consul in other datacenters. This means each datacenter runs 
independently, each having a dedicated group of servers and a private LAN gossip 
pool.

## WAN gossip pool

This tutorial covers the basic form of federating Consul datacenters using a 
single WAN gossip pool, interconnecting all Consul servers.
Consul Enterprise version 0.8.0 added support for an advanced multiple 
datacenter capability. Check the
[Federate Multiple Datacenters with Network Areas tutorial](/consul/tutorials/datacenter-operations/federation-network-areas) for more details.

## Setup two datacenters

To get started, follow the [Deployment guide](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/deployment-guide) 
to start each datacenter. If ACLs are enabled or you are using Consul Enterprise, 
you must set the [`primary_datacenter`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#primary_datacenter) in the server's configuration in both datacenters.

After bootstrapping you should have two datacenters, `dc1` and `dc2`. Note that 
datacenter names are opaque to Consul; they are simply labels that help human 
operators reason about the Consul datacenters.

To query the known WAN nodes, use the `members` command with the `-wan` 
parameter on either datacenter.

```shell-session
$ consul members -wan
```

This will provide a list of all known members in the WAN gossip pool. In
this case, you have not connected the servers so there will be no output.

`consul members -wan` should
only contain server nodes. Client nodes send requests to a datacenter-local server,
so they do not participate in WAN gossip. Client requests are forwarded by local
servers to a server in the target datacenter as necessary.

## Join the servers

The next step is to ensure that all the server nodes join the WAN gossip pool 
(include all the servers in all the datacenters).

```shell-session
$ consul join -wan <server 1> <server 2> ...
```

The `join` command is used with the `-wan` flag to indicate you are attempting 
to join a server in the WAN gossip pool. As with LAN gossip, you only need to 
join a single existing member, and the gossip protocol will be used to exchange
information about all known members. For the initial setup, however, each server
will only know about itself and must be added to the datacenter. Consul 0.8.0 
added WAN join flooding, so if one Consul server in a datacenter joins the WAN, 
it will automatically join the other servers in its local datacenter that it 
knows about via the LAN.

### Persist join with retry join

In order to persist the `join` information, the following can be added to each 
server's configuration file, in both datacenters. For example, in `dc1` server 
nodes.

<CodeTabs>

```hcl
retry_join_wan = ["dc2-server-1", "dc2-server-2"]
```

```json
{
  "retry_join_wan": ["dc2-server-1", "dc2-server-2"]
}
```

</CodeTabs>


## Verify datacenter configuration

Once the join is complete, the `members` command can be used to verify that all 
server nodes gossiping over WAN.

```shell-session
$ consul members -wan
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
Node          Address          Status  Type    Build  Protocol  DC   Segment
dc1-server-1  127.0.0.1:8701   alive   server  1.4.3  2         dc1  <all>
dc2-server-1  127.0.0.1:8702   alive   server  1.4.3  2         dc2  <all>
```

You can also verify that both datacenters are known using the
[HTTP Catalog API](/consul/api-docs/catalog#list-datacenters):

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/datacenters
["dc1", "dc2"]
```

As a simple test, you can try to query the nodes in each datacenter:

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/nodes?dc=dc1
```

```json hideClipboard
{
  "ID": "ee8b5f7b-9cc1-a382-978c-5ce4b1219a55",
  "Node": "dc1-server-1",
  "Address": "127.0.0.1",
  "Datacenter": "dc1",
  "TaggedAddresses": {
    "lan": "127.0.0.1",
    "wan": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "Meta": {
    "consul-network-segment": ""
  },
  "CreateIndex": 12,
  "ModifyIndex": 14
}
```

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/nodes?dc=dc2
```

```json hideClipboard
{
  "ID": "ee8b5f7b-9cc1-a382-978c-5ce4b1219a55",
  "Node": "dc2-server-1",
  "Address": "127.0.0.1",
  "Datacenter": "dc1",
  "TaggedAddresses": {
    "lan": "127.0.0.1",
    "wan": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "Meta": {
    "consul-network-segment": ""
  },
  "CreateIndex": 11,
  "ModifyIndex": 16
}
```

## Network configuration

There are a few networking requirements that must be satisfied for this to work. 
First, all server nodes must be able to talk to each other. Otherwise,
the gossip protocol as well as RPC forwarding will not work. If service discovery
is to be used across datacenters, the network must be able to route traffic
between IP addresses across regions as well. Usually, this means that all 
datacenters must be connected using a VPN or other tunneling mechanism. Consul 
does not handle VPN or NAT traversal for you.

Note that for RPC forwarding to work the bind address must be accessible from 
remote nodes. Configuring `serf_wan`, `advertise_addr_wan` and `translate_wan_addrs` 
can lead to a situation where `consul members -wan` lists remote nodes but RPC 
operations fail with one of the following errors:

- `No path to datacenter`
- `rpc error getting client: failed to get conn: dial tcp <LOCAL_ADDR>:0-><REMOTE_ADDR>:<REMOTE_RPC_PORT>: i/o timeout`

The most likely cause of these errors is that `bind_addr` is set to a private 
address preventing the RPC server from accepting connections across the WAN. 
Setting `bind_addr` to a public address (or one that can be routed across the WAN) 
will resolve this issue. Be aware that exposing the RPC server on a public port 
should only be done **after** firewall rules have been established.

The [`translate_wan_addrs`](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#translate_wan_addrs) 
configuration provides a basic address rewriting capability.

## Data replication

In general, data is not replicated between different Consul datacenters. When a
request is made for a resource in another datacenter, the local Consul servers 
forward an RPC request to the remote Consul servers for that resource and return 
the results. If the remote datacenter is not available, then those resources 
will also not be available, but that won't otherwise affect the local datacenter. 
There are some special situations where a limited subset of data can be 
replicated, such as with Consul's built-in ACL replication capability, or
external tools like [consul-replicate](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-replicate/).

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you setup WAN gossip across two datacenters to create basic 
federation. You also used the Consul HTTP API to ensure the datacenters were 
properly configured.
