# Link east/west network segments

This topic provides an overview of the strategies and processes for linking defined segments of your service mesh to extend east/west operations across cloud regions, runtimes, and platforms. Linking network segments into an extended service mesh enables advanced strategies for deploying and monitoring service operations in your network.

For more information about how to divide your network, including the difference between deployment strategies enabled by methods such as WAN federation and cluster peering, refer to [segment network](/consul/docs/segment).

## Introduction

Consul supports two general strategies for extending east/west service mesh traffic across your network:

- Cluster peering
- Wide Area Network (WAN) federation

Consul community edition supports basic cluster peering and federation scenarios. Implementing advanced scenarios such as federated network areas and cluster peering between multiple admin partitions in datacenters require Consul Enterprise. Refer to [Consul Enterprise](consul/docs/enterprise) for more information.

## Runtime-specific usage documentation

For runtime specific guidance, including federating clusters across runtimes, refer to the following topics:

- [Extend network east/west on virtual machines](/consul/docs/east-west/vm#guidance)
- [Extend network east/west on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/east-west/k8s#guidance)
- [WAN federation between virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters](/consul/docs/east-west/wan-federation/k8s-vm)
