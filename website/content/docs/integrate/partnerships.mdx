# Consul Integration Program

The HashiCorp Consul Integration Program enables prospective partners to build integrations with HashiCorp Consul that are reviewed and verified by HashiCorp. Consul can be consumed in two ways: **self-managed**, or **HashiCorp Cloud Platform**, a hosted version of Consul operated by HashiCorp. HCP Consul is secure by default and offers an enterprise-level SLA to deploy an organization’s most important applications.

All integrations are available with Consul’s self-managed version. In some cases, these integrations can also be validated against HCP Consul. Upon completion of the validation with HCP Consul, a partner will receive a HCP Consul Verified badge which will be displayed on their partner page and utilized on the partner’s website as well.

The program is intended to be largely self-service with links to resources, code samples, documentation, and clear integration steps.

## Categories of Consul Integrations

By leveraging Consul’s RESTful HTTP API system, prospective partners are able to build extensible integrations at the data plane, platform, and the infrastructure layer to extend Consul’s functionalities. These integrations can be performed both with the OSS (open source) version of Consul, Consul Enterprise, and HCP Consul. For features in Consul Enterprise and HCP Consul, refer to the links below:

- [HCP Consul Features](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/consul/features)
- [Consul Enterprise Features](/docs/enterprise)

**The Consul Ecosystem Architecture**

**Data Plane**: These integrations extend Consul’s certificate management, secure ACL configuration, observability metrics and logging, and service discovery that allows for dynamic service mapping APM and logging tools, extend sidecar proxies to support Consul connect, and extend API gateways to allow Consul to route incoming traffic to the proxies for Connect-enabled services.

**Control Plane**: Consul has a client-server architecture and is the control plane for the service mesh.

**Platform**: These integrations leverage automation of Consul agent deployment, configuration, and management. Designed to be platform agnostic, Consul can be deployed in a variety of form factors, including major Public Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) as well as in bare-metal, virtual machine, and container (Docker, Kubernetes) environments. They include the Consul agent running in both client and server mode.

**Infrastructure**: There are two integration options in this category: natively through a direct integration with Consul or via Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS). By leveraging Consul’s powerful **Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)*** capabilities through CTS, changes in an infrastructure are seamlessly automated when Consul detects a change in its service catalog. For example, these integrations could be used to automate IP updates of load balancers or firewall security policies by leveraging Consul service discovery.

-> **Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)***: These integrations leverage Consul’s service catalog to seamlessly integrate with Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) to automate changes in network infrastructure via a publisher-subscriber method. More details can be found [here](https://www.consul.io/docs/integrate/nia-integration).

## Development Process

The Consul integration development process is described in the steps below. By following these steps, Consul integrations can be developed alongside HashiCorp to ensure new integrations are reviewed, approved and released as quickly as possible.

<img src="/img/consul_integration_program_steps.png" alt="Integration Program Steps" style={{display:'block', margin:'auto', width:'624px'}}/>

1.  Engage: Initial contact between vendor and HashiCorp
2.  Enable: Documentation, code samples and best practices for developing the integration
3.  Develop and Test: Integration development and testing by vendor
4.  Review/Certification: HashiCorp code review and certification of integration
5.  Release: Consul integration released
6.  Support: Ongoing maintenance and support of the integration by the vendor.

### 3. Develop and Test

The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and knowledge of the [Go programming language](http://www.golang.org). Use the plugin interface to develop your integration. All integrations should contain unit and acceptance testing.

**HCP Consul**: The process to configure a testing instance of HCP consul [is very simple](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/cloud/get-started-consul). HCP has been designed as a HashiCorp managed service so configuration is minimal as only Consul client agents need to be installed. Furthermore, HashiCorp provides all new users an initial credit which should last approximately 2 months using a [development cluster](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing/consul). When deployed with AWS free tier services, there should be no cost beyond the time spent by the designated tester.

Please note that HCP Consul is currently only deployed on AWS so the partner’s application should be able to be deployed or run in AWS. For more information, please refer to [Peering an HVN to an AWS VPC for HCP Consul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuKjkIGYZlU).

- [Monitoring HCP Consul with Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/guide/hcp-consul/)

### 4. Review and Approval

HashiCorp will review and approve your Consul integration. Please send an email to [technologypartners@hashicorp.com](mailto:technologypartners@hashicorp.com) with any relevant documentation, demos or other resources and let us know your integration is ready for review.

### 5. Release

At this stage, the Consul integration is fully developed, documented, reviewed and approved. Once released, HashiCorp will officially list the Consul integration.

### 6. Support

Many vendors view the release step to be the end of the journey, while at HashiCorp we view it to be the start. Getting the Consul integration built is just the first step in enabling users. Once this is done, ongoing effort is required to maintain the integration and address any issues in a timely manner.

The expectation for vendors is to respond to all critical issues within 48 hours and all other issues within 5 business days. HashiCorp Consul has an extremely wide community of users and we encourage everyone to report issues, however small, as well as help resolve them when possible.
