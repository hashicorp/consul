# Configure Envoy proxy properties

This topic describes how to use the `property-override` extension to set and remove individual properties for the Envoy resources Consul generates. The extension uses [`protoreflect`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect), which enables Consul to dynamically manipulate messages.

The extension currently supports setting scalar and enum fields, removing individual fields addressable by `Path`, and initializing unset intermediate message fields indicated in `Path`.

It currently does _not_ support the following use cases:
- Adding, updating, or removing repeated field members
- Adding or updating [protobuf `map`](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#maps) fields
- Adding or updating [protobuf `Any`](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#any) fields

## Workflow

Complete the following steps to use the `property-override` extension:

1. Configure an `EnvoyExtensions` block in a service defaults or proxy defaults configuration entry. 
1. Apply the configuration entry.

<Warning title="Security warning">
  The property override extension is an advanced feature capable of introducing unintended consequences or reducing cluster security if used incorrectly. Consul does not enforce TLS retention, intentions, or other security-critical components of the Envoy configuration. Additionally, Consul does not verify that the configuration does not contain errors that affect service traffic.
</Warning>

## Add the `EnvoyExtensions`

Add Envoy extension configurations to a proxy defaults or service defaults configuration entry. Place the extension configuration in an `EnvoyExtensions` block in the configuration entry.

- When you configure Envoy extensions on proxy defaults, they apply to every service.
- When you configure Envoy extensions on service defaults, they apply to a specific service.

Consul applies Envoy extensions configured in proxy defaults before it applies extensions in service defaults. As a result, the Envoy extension configuration in service defaults may override configurations in proxy defaults.

The following example shows a service defaults configuration entry named `api` that sets the `/respect_dns_ttl` field for the `other-svc` upstream service:

          Op    = "add"
          Path  = "/respect_dns_ttl"
          Value = true

Refer to the [property override configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/proxy/envoy-extensions/configuration/property-override) for details on how to configure the extension. 

Refer to the [proxy defaults configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/proxy-defaults) and [service defaults configuration entry reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/service-default) for details on how to define the configuration entries. 

<Warning>
  Adding Envoy extensions default proxy configurations may have unintended consequences. We recommend configuring `EnvoyExtensions` in service defaults configuration entries in most cases.
</Warning>

### Constructing paths

To target the properties for an Envoy resource type, you must specify the path where the properties exist in the [`Path` field](/consul/docs/reference/proxy/envoy-extensions/configuration/property-override#patches-path) of the property override extension configuration. 

To view a list of supported fields for the `Path` field, set the `Path` field to an empty or partially invalid string. Consul will return an error with a list of supported fields for the first unrecognized segment of the path. By default, Consul only returns the first ten fields, but you can set the [`Debug` field](/consul/docs/reference/proxy/envoy-extensions/configuration/property-override#debug) to `true`  to direct Consul to output all possible fields. 

The following examplem configure will trigger Consul to return an error with the top-level fields available for the Envoy cluster resource:

```hcl
Kind = "service-defaults"
Name = "api"
EnvoyExtensions = [
  {
    Name = "builtin/property-override"
    Arguments = {
      Debug = true
      ProxyType = "connect-proxy"
      Patches = [
        {
          ResourceFilter = {
            ResourceType = "cluster"
            TrafficDirection = "outbound"
          }
          Op = "add"
          Path =  ""
          Value =  5
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

After applying the configuration entry, Consul prints a message that includes the possible fields for the resource:

```shell-session
$ consul config write api.hcl
non-empty, non-root Path is required;
available envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster fields:
transport_socket_matches
name
alt_stat_name
type
cluster_type
eds_cluster_config
connect_timeout
## ...
```

You can use the output to help you construct the appropriate value for the `Path` field. For example:

```shell-session
$ consul config write api.hcl 2>&1 | grep round_robin
round_robin_lb_config
```

## Apply the configuration entry

If your network is deployed to virtual machines, use the `consul config write` command and specify the proxy defaults or service defaults configuration entry to apply the configuration. For Kubernetes-orchestrated networks, use the `kubectl apply` command. The following example applies the extension in a proxy defaults configuration entry.

<CodeTabs tabs={[ "HCL", "JSON", "YAML" ]}>

```shell-session
$ consul config write property-override-extension-service-defaults.hcl
```

```shell-session
$ consul config write property-override-extension-service-defaults.json
```

```shell-session
$ kubectl apply property-override-extension-service-defaults.yaml
```
