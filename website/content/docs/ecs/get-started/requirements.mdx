  Requirements for Consul Service Mesh on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).
---

# Requirements

Currently, the following requirements must be met in order to install Consul on ECS:

1. **Terraform:** The tasks that you want to add to the service mesh must first be modeled in Terraform.
1. **Launch Type:** ECS Tasks can run on either Fargate or EC2.
1. **Subnets:** ECS Tasks can run in private or public subnets. Tasks must have [network access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-pull-container-api-error-ecr/) to Amazon ECR to pull images.
1. **Consul Servers:** Currently, Consul servers must run inside ECS using the `dev-server` Terraform module. This is a development/testing only server that does not support persistent storage. In the future, we will support production-ready Consul servers running in HashiCorp Cloud Platform and on EC2 VMs.
1. **TLS, ACLs, Gossip Encryption:** Currently, Consul production features such as TLS, ACLs, and Gossip Encryption are not supported. This will be added in the future.
