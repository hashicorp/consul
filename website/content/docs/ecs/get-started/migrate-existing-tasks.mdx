# Migrate Existing Tasks

This topic describes how to migrate your existing ECS Tasks to use our [`mesh-task` Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/mesh-task).

## Define Tasks in Terraform

Your tasks must first be specified in Terraform using the [`ecs_task_definition`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecs_task_definition)
resource so that they can then be converted to use the [`mesh-task` module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/mesh-task).

For example, your tasks should be defined with Terraform similar to the following:

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "my_task" {
  family                   = "my_task"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  cpu                      = 256
  memory                   = 512
  execution_role_arn       = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/execution-role"
  task_role_arn            = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/task-role"
  container_definitions = jsonencode(
    [{
      name             = "example-client-app"
      image            = "docker.io/org/my_task:v0.0.1"
      essential        = true
      portMappings = [
        {
          containerPort = 9090
          hostPort      = 9090
          protocol      = "tcp"
        }
      ]
      cpu         = 0
      mountPoints = []
      volumesFrom = []
    }]
  )
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "my_task" {
  name            = "my_task"
  cluster         = "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:cluster/my-cluster"
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task.arn
  desired_count   = 1
  network_configuration {
    subnets = ["subnet-abc123"]
  }
  launch_type            = "FARGATE"
}
```

## Convert to the `mesh-task` Module

In order to add the necessary sidecar containers for your task to join the mesh,
you must use the [`mesh-task` module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/mesh-task).

The `mesh-task` module uses inputs similar to your old ECS task definition but
creates a new version of the task definition with additional containers.

The `mesh-task` module is used as follows:

```hcl
module "my_task" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws-ecs//modules/mesh-task"
  version = "<latest version>"

  family                = "my_task"
  container_definitions = [
    {
      name         = "example-client-app"
      image        = "docker.io/org/my_task:v0.0.1"
      essential    = true
      portMappings = [
        {
          containerPort = 9090
          hostPort      = 9090
          protocol      = "tcp"
        }
      ]
      cpu         = 0
      mountPoints = []
      volumesFrom = []
    }
  ]

  port       = "9090"
  retry_join = ["<address of the Consul server>"]
}
```

The main differences are:

- You must remove the `execution_role_arn` and `task_role_arn` fields. The `mesh-task` module will create the task and execution roles.
- You must set the `port` field to the port that your application listens on.
  If your application has no listening port, set `outbound_only = true` and remove the `port` field.
- You must add the `retry_join` field. This specifies the location of your Consul servers so that your task can join the mesh.
- You must remove the `jsonencode()` function from the `container_definitions` field.

The `mesh-task` module will create a new version of your task definition with the
necessary sidecar containers added so you can delete your existing `aws_ecs_task_definition`
resource.

## Next Steps

Now that your task(s) are migrated to the `mesh-task` module,

- Start at the [ECS Service section](/docs/ecs/get-started/install#ecs-service) of the Installation Guide to continue installing Consul on ECS.
- Refer to the [`mesh-task` reference documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/mesh-task?tab=inputs) for all available inputs to your mesh tasks.
