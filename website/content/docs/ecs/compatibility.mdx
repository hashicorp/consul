# Compatibility Matrix for Consul on ECS

For every release of Consul on ECS, `consul-ecs` binary and `consul-ecs` terraform module is updated. The terraform module and binary are tightly coupled. Ex: consul-ecs binary 0.4.1 must use consul-ecs terraform 0.4.1.

## Supported Consul versions

### Version 0.2.0 and above


| Consul Version | Compatible consul-ecs Versions  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.10.x         | 0.2.x                           |
| 1.11.x         | 0.3.0, 0.4.x                    |


## Supported Envoy versions

Supported versions of Envoy for Consul versions are also found in [Envoy - Supported Versions](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions). The recommended best practice is to use the default version of Envoy that is provided in the terraform module, as that is the version that has been tested with Consul ECS binaries for a given version.
