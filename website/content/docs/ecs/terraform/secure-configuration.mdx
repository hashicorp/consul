# Secure Configuration for Consul on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Terraform

This topic describes how to enable Consul security features for your production workloads.

## Overview

To enable security in your production workloads, you must deploy the [ACL controller](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/acl-controller), which provisions tokens for other service mesh tasks. Refer to [Architecture](/consul/docs/ecs/architecture#acl-controller) to learn more about the ACL controller.

The controller cannot provision tokens for itself, so you must create the token for the ACL controller. The following steps describe the overall process of enabling security features for your production workloads:

1. Enable the security features on your Consul server cluster per the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. Create the ACL token for the ACL controller in the datacenter.
1. Create a Secrets Manager secret containing the ACL controller's token.
1. Create a Secrets Manager secret containing the Consul CA certificate.
1. Deploy the ACL controller
1. Deploy the other services on the mesh.

## Prerequisites

Implement the following security features for your Consul server clusters before applying them to your workloads:

1. [TLS encryption](/consul/docs/security/encryption#rpc-encryption-with-tls) for RPC communication between Consul clients and servers.
1. [Gossip encryption](/consul/docs/security/encryption#gossip-encryption) for encrypting gossip traffic.
1. [Access control lists (ACLs)](/consul/docs/security/acl) for authentication and authorization for Consul clients and services on the mesh.

## Auth Method

Consul on ECS uses the [AWS IAM Auth Method](/consul/docs/ecs/architecture#aws-iam-auth-method) to enable
tasks to automatically obtain Consul ACL tokens during startup.

With the Terraform modules for Consul on ECS, the auth method is supported by default when ACLs are
enabled. The ACL controller sets up the auth method on the Consul servers. The `mesh-task` module
configures the ECS task definition to be compatible with the auth method.

A unique task IAM role is required for each ECS task family. Task IAM roles must not be shared by
different task families. This is because the task family represents only one Consul service and the
task IAM role must encode the Consul service name.

By default, the `mesh-task` module will create and configure the task IAM role for you.

~> **Note:** When passing an existing IAM role to the `mesh-task` module using the `task_role` input
variable, you must configure the IAM role as described in [ECS Task Role
Configuration](/consul/docs/ecs/manual/secure-configuration#ecs-task-role-configuration) to be compatible with
the AWS IAM auth method.

## ACL controller

1. Create a policy that grants `acl:write` and `operator:write` access for the controller. Refer to the [ACL policies documentation](/consul/docs/security/acl/acl-policies) for instructions.
1. Create a token and link it to the ACL controller policy. Refer to the [ACL tokens documentation](/consul/docs/security/acl/acl-tokens) for instructions.
1. Create a Secrets Manager secret containing the ACL controller's token and a Secrets Manager secret containing the Consul CA cert.

```hcl
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "bootstrap_token" {
  name  = "bootstrap-token"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "bootstrap_token" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.bootstrap_token.id
  secret_string = "<bootstrap token>"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "ca_cert" {
  name  = "server-ca-cert"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "ca_cert" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ca_cert.id
  secret_string = "<CA certificate for the Consul server's HTTPS endpoint>"
}
```

1. Use the [`acl-controller` terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/submodules/acl-controller?tab=inputs) to deploy the controller. You must provide the ARN's for the token and CA cert in the `consul_bootstrap_token_secret_arn` and `consul_server_ca_cert_arn` fields, respectively.

   ```hcl
   module "acl_controller" {
     source                            = "hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws//modules/acl-controller"
     version                           = "<version>"

     consul_bootstrap_token_secret_arn = aws_secretsmanager_secret.bootstrap_token.arn
     consul_server_http_addr           = "https://consul-server.example.com:8501"
     consul_server_ca_cert_arn         = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ca_cert.arn
     ecs_cluster_arn                   = "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:cluster/consul-ecs"
     region                            = "us-east-1"
     subnets                           = ["subnet-abcdef123456789"]
     name_prefix                       = "consul-ecs"
   }
   ```

If you are using Consul Enterprise, see the [Admin Partitions and Namespaces requirements documentation](/consul/docs/ecs/requirements) for additional configuration required to support Consul Enterprise on ECS.

## Deploy your services

Follow the instructions described in [Create a task definition](/consul/docs/ecs/terraform/install#create-the-task-definition) to create the basic configuration for the task module. Add the following additional configurations to make the configuration production-ready.

### Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret

The secret stores the gossip encryption key that the Consul clients use.

<CodeBlockConfig>

```hcl
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "gossip_key" {
  name  = "gossip-encryption-key"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "gossip_key" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.gossip_key.id
  secret_string = "<Gossip encryption key>"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Enable secure deployment

To enable secure deployment, add the following configuration to the task module.

```hcl
module "my_task" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws//modules/mesh-task"
  version = "<version>"

  ...

  tls                       = true
  consul_server_ca_cert_arn = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ca_cert.arn
  gossip_key_secret_arn     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.gossip_key.arn

  acls                      = true
  consul_http_addr          = "https://consul-server.example.com:8501"
  consul_https_ca_cert_arn  = aws_secretsmanager_secret.ca_cert.arn
  audit_logging             = true
}
```

The following table explains the `mesh-task` input variables relevant to a secure configuration:
