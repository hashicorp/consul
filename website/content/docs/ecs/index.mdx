## Service Mesh

Using Consul on AWS ECS enables you to add your ECS tasks to the service mesh and
take advantage of features such as zero-trust-security, intentions, observability,
traffic policy, and more.

## Example Installation

See our [Example Installation](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/examples/dev-server-fargate)
to learn how to install Consul on an example ECS cluster along with example service mesh applications.

## Install

See our full [Install Guide](/docs/ecs/get-started/install) when you're ready to install Consul
on an existing ECS cluster and add existing tasks to the service mesh.
