# AWS ECS

Consul can be deployed on [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (Elastic Container Service) using our official Terraform modules.

## Service Mesh

Using Consul on AWS ECS enables you to add your ECS tasks to the service mesh and
take advantage of features such as zero-trust-security, intentions, observability,
traffic policy, and more.

## Getting Started

There are several ways to get started with Consul with ECS.

* The [Serverless Consul Service Mesh with ECS and HCP](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/cloud/consul-ecs-hcp?in=consul/cloud-integrations) learn guide shows how to use Terraform to run Consul service mesh applications on ECS with managed Consul servers running in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).
* The [Service Mesh with ECS and Consul on EC2](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/consul-ecs-ec2?in=consul/cloud-integrations) learn guide shows how to use Terraform to run Consul service mesh applications on ECS with Consul servers running on EC2 instances.
* The [Consul with Dev Server on Fargate](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/examples/dev-server-fargate) example installation deploys a sample application in ECS using the Fargate launch type.
* The [Consul with Dev Server on EC2](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul-ecs/aws/latest/examples/dev-server-ec2) example installation deploys a sample application in ECS using the EC2 launch type.

See the [Requirements](/docs/ecs/get-started/requirements) and the full [Install Guide](/docs/ecs/get-started/install) when you're ready to install Consul on an existing ECS cluster and add existing tasks to the service mesh.
