# Install the ACL Controller

This topic describes how to manually deploy the ACL controller to [automatically provision ACL tokens](/docs/ecs/architecture#automatic-acl-token-provisioning) for Consul on ECS.
If you are using Terraform, refer to the [Terraform Secure Configuration](/docs/ecs/terraform/secure-configuration) page to deploy the ACL controller.

## Prerequisites

* Your application tasks must include certain tags to be compatible with the ACL controller.
Refer to the [Task Tags](/docs/ecs/manual/install#task-tags) section of the installation page.
* You should be familiar with configuring Consul's secure features, including how to create ACL tokens and policies. Refer to the following [Learn Guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/consul/security) for an introduction and the [ACL system](/docs/security/acl) documentation for more information.

## Set Up Secrets

The ACL controller supports managing secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

Before deploying the ACL controller for the first time, you must [create the following secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html) from Consul in AWS Secrets Manager.

| Secret                  | Initial Value  | Sample Secret Name             |
| ---------------------   | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Consul server CA cert   | Set            | `my-consul-ca-cert`            |
| Bootstrap ACL Token     | Set            | `my-consul-bootstrap-token`    |
| Consul Client ACL Token | Empty          | `<PREFIX>-consul-client-token` |

The secret for the client token must be initially empty. The ACL controller creates the client token in Consul
and stores the token in Secrets Manager. In the secret name, `<PREFIX>` should be replaced with the
[secret name prefix](/docs/ecs/manual/acl-controller#secret-name-prefix) of your choice.

### Secret Name Prefix

The ACL controller requires that the secrets it reads and writes are named with a unique prefix. The name prefix is used
in the [Task Role Policy](/docs/ecs/manual/acl-controller#task-role-policy) to limit the ACL controller's access within
AWS Secrets Manager to only those secrets strictly needed by the ACL controller.

The name prefix should be unique among secrets in your AWS account. We recommend using a short (8 character) random
string for the prefix.

-> **NOTE:** If you are using the ACL controller with multiple ECS clusters, each cluster requires
its own instance of the ACL controller, and each instance of the ACL controller should have a unique
name prefix.

## Task Definition

You must create a task definition to deploy the ACL controller in your ECS cluster.
The ACL controller must run in the same ECS cluster hosting your service mesh application
tasks.

The following example shows how the task definition should be configured for the ACL controller.

```json
{
  "family": "my-consul-acl-controller",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "acl-controller",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs:<CONSUL_ECS_VERSION>",
      "essential": true,
      "command": [
        "acl-controller",
        "-consul-client-secret-arn", "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:<PREFIX>-consul-client-token",
        "-secret-name-prefix", "<PREFIX>",
      ],
      "secrets": [
        {
          "name": "CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN",
          "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:my-consul-bootstrap-token"
        },
        {
          "name": "CONSUL_CACERT_PEM",
          "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:my-consul-ca-cert"
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR",
          "value": "<Consul server HTTP API address>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You must include the following top-level fields.

| Field name    | Type    | Description                                                                  |
| -----------   | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `family`      | string  | The task family name of your choice.                                         |
| `networkMode` | string  | Must be `awsvpc`, which is the only network mode supported by Consul on ECS. |

In the `containerDefinitions` list, include one container with the following fields.

| Field name    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -----------   | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string  | The container name, which should be `acl-controller`                                                                             |
| `image`       | string  | The `consul-ecs` image. Use our public AWS registry, `public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs`, to avoid rate limits.                |
| `command`     | list    | Must be set as shown. The startup command for the ACL controller.                                                                |

| `secrets`     | list    | Must have `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` set to the ACL bootstrap token and `CONSUL_CACERT_PEM` set to the Consul server CA certificate.    |
| `environment` | string  | Must set the `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` environment variable to the address of the HTTP API of your Consul servers.                      |

The following CLI options are required in the `command` field of the container definition.

| Flag                        | Type    | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-consul-client-secret-arn` | string  | The secret where the ACL controller will store the Consul client token.                                              |
| `-secret-name-prefix`       | string  | The [secret name prefix](/docs/ecs/manual/acl-controller#secret-name-prefix) that you chose for this ACL controller. |

## ECS Service

Once the task definition is created, define an ECS service in order to start an ACL controller task.

The following example contains the recommended settings for the ACL controller. Refer to
the [ECS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_definition_parameters.html) documentation
to complete the remaining details for your use case.

```json
{
   "cluster": "<Your ECS cluster ARN>"
   "desiredCount": 1,
   "launchType": "FARGATE",
   "serviceName": "my-acl-controller",
   "taskDefinition": "<task definition ARN>",
   ...
}
```

| Field name       | Type    | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cluster`        | string  | Set to your ECS cluster name or ARN. This must be the same ECS cluster where your service mesh applications run. |
| `desiredCount`   | integer | Must be `1`. Only one instance of the ACL controller should run per ECS cluster.                                   |
| `launchType`     | string  | Consul on ECS supports both the `FARGATE` and `EC2` launch types.                                                |
| `serviceName`    | string  | The service name of your choice.                                                                                 |
| `taskDefinition` | string  | Must be set to the ACL controller [task definition](/docs/ecs/manual/acl-controller#task-definition).            |

## AWS IAM Roles

The ECS task and execution roles must be configured to allow the ACL controller access
to the ECS API and Secrets Manager API.

### Task Role Policy

The following example shows the policy needed for the ECS task role for the ACL controller.
This grants the ACL controller permission to list tasks, describe tasks, and read and update
secrets.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecs:ListTasks",
        "ecs:DescribeTasks"
      ],
      "Resource": ["*"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:UpdateSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:<PREFIX>-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The following are the required permissions. You will need to substitute `<PREFIX>` with your chosen [name prefix](/docs/ecs/manual/acl-controller#secret-name-prefix).

| Action                          | Resource                                                          | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ecs:ListTasks`                 | `*`                                                               | Allow the ACL controller to watch for new tasks.                                   |
| `ecs:DescribeTasks`             | `*`                                                               | Allow the ACL controller to retrieve details for new tasks.                        |
| `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` | `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:<PREFIX>-*` | Allow the ACL controller to read secrets with a name prefix.                       |
| `secretsmanager:UpdateSecret`   | `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:<PREFIX>-*` | Allow the ACL controller to store Consul ACL tokens in secrets with a name prefix. |

### Execution Role Policy

The following IAM policy document allows ECS to retrieve secrets needed
to start the ACL controller task from AWS Secrets Manager, including the ACL
bootstrap token.

The following example shows the policy needed for the execution role.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:my-consul-bootstrap-token",
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:000000000000:secret:<PREFIX>-consul-client-token"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
