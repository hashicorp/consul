# Manual Installation of Consul on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

The following instructions describe how to use the [`consul-ecs` Docker image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs) to manually create the ECS task definition without Terraform. If you prefer to use Terraform, refer to [Consul ECS Terraform module](/docs/ecs/terraform/install).

If you intend to peer the service mesh to multiple Consul datacenters or partitions, you must use the Consul ECS Terraform module to install your service mesh on ECS. Manually configuring mesh gateways without using the `gateway-task` Terraform module is not supported.

This topic does not include instructions for creating all AWS resources necessary to install Consul, such as a VPC or the ECS cluster. Refer to the linked guides in the [Getting Started](/docs/ecs#getting-started) section for complete, runnable examples.

## Prerequisites

You should have some familiarity with AWS ECS. See [What is Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) for details.

## Task Definition

Configure a task definition that creates the containers:

- Your application container
- An Envoy sidecar-proxy container
- A Consul client container
- A `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container for service mesh setup
- (Optional) A `consul-ecs-health-sync` container to sync ECS health checks into Consul

## Top-level fields

Your task definition must include the following top-level fields.

The `volumes` list contains two [bind mounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/bind-mounts.html),
named `consul_data` and `consul_binary`. Bind mounts are directories on the host which can be mounted into one or more containers
in order to share files among containers. For Consul on ECS, certain binaries and configuration are shared among containers
during task startup.

```json
{
  "family": "my-example-client-app",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "volumes": [
    {
      "name": "consul_data"
    },
    {
      "name": "consul_binary"
    }
  ],
  "containerDefinitions": [...],
  "tags": [
    {
      "key": "consul.hashicorp.com/mesh",
      "value": "true"
    },
    {
      "key": "consul.hashicorp.com/service-name",
      "value":  "example-client-app"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field name             | Type   | Description                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `family`               | string | The task family name. This is used as the Consul service name by default.                                          |
| `networkMode`          | string | Must be `awsvpc`, which is the only network mode supported by Consul on ECS.                                       |
| `volumes`              | list   | Must be defined as shown above. Volumes are used to share configuration between containers for initial task setup. |
| `containerDefinitions` | list   | The list of containers to run in this task (see [Application container](#application-container)).                  |

### Task Tags

The `tags` list must include the following if you are using the ACL controller in a [secure configuration](/docs/ecs/manual/secure-configuration).
Without these tags, the ACL controller will be unable to provision a service token for the task.

| Tag Key                             | Tag Value              | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.hashicorp.com/mesh`         | `true` (string)        | The ACL controller ignores tasks without this tag set to `true`.                                                                                |
| `consul.hashicorp.com/service-name` | Consul service name    | Specifies the Consul service associated with this task. Required if the service name is different than the task `family`.                       |
| `consul.hashicorp.com/partition`    | Consul admin partition | <EnterpriseAlert inline />Specifies the Consul admin partition associated with this task. Defaults to the `default` admin partition if omitted. |
| `consul.hashicorp.com/namespace`    | Consul namespace       | <EnterpriseAlert inline />Specifies the Consul namespace associated with this task. Defaults to the `default` namespace if omitted.             |

## Application container

First, include your application container in the `containerDefinitions` list
in the task definition.

Ensure that the `containerName` and `condition` fields in the `dependsOn` list
are specified as described in the following example. These are container dependencies,
which must be used to enforce a specific [startup order](/docs/ecs/architecture#task-startup).
By using the following settings, your application container will start after `consul-ecs-mesh-init`
has completed task setup and after `sidecar-proxy` is ready to proxy traffic between
this task and the service mesh.

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "example-client-app",
      "image": "docker.io/org/my_task:v0.0.1",
      "essential": true,
      "dependsOn": [
        {
          "containerName": "consul-ecs-mesh-init",
          "condition": "SUCCESS"
        },
        {
          "containerName": "sidecar-proxy",
          "condition": "HEALTHY"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field name  | Type    | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| `name`      | string  | The name of your application container.                                                                                           |
| `image`     | string  | The container image used to run your application.                                                                                 |
| `essential` | boolean | Must be `true` to ensure the health of your application container affects the health status of the task.                          |
| `dependsOn` | list    | Must be set as shown above. Container dependencies ensure your application container starts after service mesh setup is complete. |

See the [ECS Task Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html) documentation for a complete reference.

## `sidecar-proxy` container

The `sidecar-proxy` container runs [Envoy proxy](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy) for Consul Connect. In most cases, the container should contain the following parameters and values.

The `mountPoints` list must be set as shown in the following example. This will mount the shared `consul_data` volume into the
`sidecar-proxy` container at the path `/consul`. This volume is where the `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container copies the `envoy-bootstrap.json`
file and the `consul-ecs` binary, which are required to start Envoy. The `dependsOn` list must also be defined as follows to ensure the
`sidecar-proxy` container starts after `consul-ecs-mesh-init` has successfully written these files to the shared volume.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="8-40">

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "example-client-app",

| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string  | The container name, which must be `sidecar-proxy`.                                                                                                         |
| `image`       | string  | The Envoy image. This must be a [supported version of Envoy](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions).                                              |
| `dependsOn`   | list    | Must be set as shown above to ensure Envoy starts after the `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container has written the `envoy-bootstrap.json` config file for Envoy. |
| `healthCheck` | list    | Must be set as shown above to monitor the health of Envoy's primary listener port, which ties into container dependencies and startup ordering.            |
| `mountPoints` | list    | Must be set as shown above to access the files shared in the `/consul` directory, like the Envoy bootstrap configuration file and the `consul-ecs` binary. |
| `ulimits`     | list    | The `nofile` ulimit must be raised to a sufficiently high value so that Envoy does not fail to open sockets.                                               |
| `entrypoint`  | list    | Must be set to the custom Envoy entrypoint, `consul-ecs envoy-entrypoint`, to facilitate graceful shutdown.                                                |
| `command`     | list    | The startup command. This passes the bootstrap configuration to Envoy.                                                                                     |

-> **NOTE**: Envoy and Consul must be compatible versions. See the [supported versions of Envoy](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions) in the Consul documentation.

## `consul-client` container

Each task must include a Consul client container in order for the task to join your Consul cluster.

| `command`     | list    | Specifies the contents of the [startup script](#consul-client-startup-script). Copy the script and format it into a JSON string.  |

### Consul client startup script

The following script is used to start the Consul client for Consul on ECS.

```shell
# Copy the consul binary to a shared volume for `consul-ecs-mesh-init` to use to generate Envoy configuration.
cp /bin/consul /bin/consul-inject/consul

# At runtime, determine the IP address assigned to this ECS Task.
ECS_IPV4=$(curl -s $ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4 | jq -r '.Networks[0].IPv4Addresses[0]')

# Write the Consul agent configuration file.
cat << EOF > /consul/agent-defaults.hcl
addresses = {
  dns = "127.0.0.1"
  grpc = "127.0.0.1"
  http = "127.0.0.1"
}
advertise_addr = "$ECS_IPV4"
advertise_reconnect_timeout = "15m"
client_addr = "0.0.0.0"
datacenter = "dc1"
enable_central_service_config = true
leave_on_terminate = true
ports {
  grpc = 8502
}
retry_join = ["<consul server location>"]
telemetry {
  disable_compat_1.9 = true
}

EOF

# Start the consul agent.
exec consul agent \
    -data-dir /consul/data \
    -config-file /consul/agent-defaults.hcl
```

The following table describes the values that you should use to configure the `command` script:

| Field name           | Type    | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addresses.*`        | strings | Set the DNS, GRPC, and HTTP addresses to `127.0.0.1` to ensure these are not accessible outside of the task. |
| `advertise_addr`     | string  | Must be set to the task IP address so that other Consul agents know how to reach this agent.                 |
| `client_addr`        | string  | Must be set to an interface reachable by other Consul agents.                                                |
| `datacenter`         | string  | Must be set to the Consul datacenter this task will join.                                                    |
| `leave_on_terminate` | boolean | Must be set to `true` so that the Consul agent leaves the cluster gracefully before exiting.                 |
| `retry_join`         | string  | Must be set to your Consul server location(s) so this agent can join the Consul cluster.                     |

-> **NOTE**: Use `exec` to start the Consul agent so that the Consul agent runs as PID 1. This ensures
the Consul agent directly receives signals from ECS, which is important for graceful shutdown of the Consul agent.

Refer to the [Consul Agent documentation](/docs/agent/config/config-files#configuration_files) for a complete reference of Consul agent
configuration options.

## `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container

The `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container runs at task startup to setup this instance for Consul service mesh.
It registers the service and proxy for this task with Consul and writes Envoy bootstrap
configuration to a shared volume.

| `environment` | list    | This must include the [`CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON`](/docs/ecs/manual/install#consul_ecs_config_json) variable. See below for details. |

### `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON`

Consul uses the `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON` environment variable to passed configurations to the `consul-ecs` binary in JSON format.

The following example configures a service named `example-client-app` with one upstream
service name `example-server-app`. The `proxy` and `service` blocks include information used by `consul-ecs-mesh-init` to register the service with Consul during task start up.
The same configuration format is used for
the `consul-ecs-health-sync` container.

```json
{
  "bootstrapDir": "/consul",
  "healthSyncContainers": [],
  "proxy": {
    "upstreams": [
      {
        "destinationName": "example-server-app",
        "localBindPort": 1234
      }
    ]
  },
  "service": {
    "checks": [],
    "meta": {},
    "name": "example-client-app",
    "port": 9090,
    "tags": []

## `consul-ecs-health-sync` container

Optionally, Consul ECS can sync health checks for this task into Consul checks.
This allows you to configure a health check for your application in one place and
see a consistent health status in both ECS and Consul.

For example, the following defines an ECS health check command that runs `curl localhost:9090/health`:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="6-11">

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "example-client-app",
      "image": "docker.io/org/my_task:v0.0.1",
      "healthCheck": {
        "retries": 3,
        "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl localhost:9090/health"],
        "timeout": 5,
        "interval": 30
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

First, define which containers need their health status synced into Consul. To do this,
add the container name(s) to the `healthSyncContainers` list of the `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON` variable,
as shown in the following example. This configuration must be passed to both the `consul-ecs-mesh-init`
and `consul-ecs-health-sync` containers.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="3-3">

```json
{
  "bootstrapDir": "/consul",
  "healthSyncContainers": ["example-client-app"],
  ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Next, set the `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON` variable for the `consul-ecs-mesh-init` container.
The following example shows how the `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON` variable should be formatted.
The JSON configuration is compacted down to a single line and escaped.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="7-10">

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "consul-ecs-mesh-init",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs:<VERSION>",
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON",
          "value": "{\"bootstrapDir\":\"/consul\",\"healthSyncContainers\":[\"example-client-app\"],\"proxy\":{\"upstreams\":[{\"destinationName\":\"example-server-app\",\"localBindPort\":1234}]},\"service\":{\"checks\":[],\"meta\":{},\"name\":\"example-client-app\",\"port\":9090,\"tags\":[]}}"
        }
      ],
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Finally, include the `consul-ecs-health-sync` container in the `containerDefinitions` list.
Pass the same value for `CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON` for both the `consul-ecs-health-sync`
and `consul-ecs-mesh-init` containers.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="23-40">

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "example-client-app",
      "image": "docker.io/org/my_task:v0.0.1",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "sidecar-proxy",
      "image": "envoyproxy/envoy-alpine:<ENVOY_VERSION>",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "consul-client"
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul:<CONSUL_VERSION>",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "consul-ecs-mesh-init",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs:<CONSUL_ECS_VERSION>",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "consul-ecs-health-sync",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/hashicorp/consul-ecs:<CONSUL_ECS_VERSION>",
      "command": ["health-sync"],
      "essential": false,
      "dependsOn": [
        {
          "containerName": "consul-ecs-mesh-init",
          "condition": "SUCCESS"
        }
      ],
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "CONSUL_ECS_CONFIG_JSON",
          "value": "{\"bootstrapDir\":\"/consul\",\"healthSyncContainers\":[\"example-client-app\"],\"proxy\":{\"upstreams\":[{\"destinationName\":\"example-server-app\",\"localBindPort\":1234}]},\"service\":{\"checks\":[],\"meta\":{},\"name\":\"example-client-app\",\"port\":9090,\"tags\":[]}}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
