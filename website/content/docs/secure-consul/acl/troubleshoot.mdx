# Troubleshoot ACLs

https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials/security/access-control-troubleshoot

Consul provides a robust set of APIs that you can use to check the health of 
your datacenter. In this tutorial, you will learn about several Consul CLI 
commands that you can use to troubleshoot issues with tokens and policies. 
Additionally, you will learn about the ACL system reset procedure that can be 
used in case of an emergency.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes an existing datacenter running Consul 1.4 or newer. Access 
to a machine where you can execute Consul CLI commands, either a Consul agent or 
a local binary configured to control the remote datacenter.

All commands in this tutorial will need a valid token. For ease, we recommend 
using the initial management token since it has unlimited privileges.

## Consul members

You can use the `consul members` [command](/consul/commands/members) 
when configuring agents with tokens to check that they have the necessary 
privileges to join the datacenter.

If an agent, server or client, is missing from the members list then ACLs have 
not been configured correctly on that agent or the token does not have the 
correct privileges. Only agents that have privileges to register themselves in 
the catalog will be included in the member list.

```shell-session
$ consul members
Node       Address         Status    Type    Build  Protocol  DC   Segment
server-1  172.17.0.2:8301  alive     server  1.4.4  2         dc1  <all>
server-2  172.17.0.3:8301  alive     server  1.4.4  2         dc1  <all>
server-3  172.17.0.4:8301  alive     server  1.4.4  2         dc1  <all>
```

Use the `consul acl` commands listed in the following sections to help 
troubleshoot token privileges.

## Consul catalog

The `consul catalog nodes -detailed` [command](/consul/commands/catalog/nodes)
 will display node information, including "TaggedAddresses". If 
 "TaggedAddresses" is null for any of the agents, that agentâ€™s ACLs are not 
 configured correctly. You can start debugging by reviewing the Consul logs on 
 all the servers. If ACLs are enabled correctly, you can investigate the agent's 
 token.

```shell-session
$ consul catalog nodes -detailed
Node      ID                  Address   DC  TaggedAddresses
server-1  a82c7db3-fdc3  192.168.1.191  kc  lan=192.168.1.191, wan=192.168.1.190
server-2  a82c7db3-fdc3  192.168.1.192  kc  lan=192.168.1.192, wan=192.168.1.190
server-3  a82c7db3-fdc3  192.168.1.193   kc  lan=192.168.1.193, wan=192.168.1.190
```

Use the `consul acl` commands listed below to help troubleshoot troubleshoot 
token privileges.

## Consul ACL

Once you've confirmed the issue is not due to misconfiguration, you can use the 
following commands to help troubleshoot token or policy issues.

### Consul ACL policy list

The `consul acl policy list` [command](/consul/commands/acl/policy/list) 
will output all the available policies. When you're first setting up tokens you 
should use it to ensure the list of policies and their rules are as expected. In 
the example output below, there are two policies; the Consul created 
`global-management` policy and a user created policy named `server-one-policy`.

```shell-session
$ consul acl policy list
global-management:
   ID:           00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
   Description:  Builtin Policy that grants unlimited access
   Datacenters:
server-one-policy:
   ID:           0bcee22c-6602-9dd6-b147-964958069426
   Description:  policy for server one
   Datacenters:

```

You can use `consul acl policy read -id <policy_id>` to investigate individual 
policies. In the example output below, the `server-one-policy` policy has node 
write privileges for node "consul-server-one".

```shell-session
$ consul acl policy read -id 0bcee22c-6602-9dd6-b147-964958069426
ID:           0bcee22c-6602-9dd6-b147-964958069426
Name:         server-one-policy
Description:  policy for server one
Datacenters:
Rules:
node "consul-server-one" {
  policy = "write"
}
```

### Consul ACL token list

The `consul acl token list` [command](/consul/commands/acl/policy/list) 
will list all the tokens. Ensure this list only includes the tokens in use. It 
is important for the security of your datacenter and you should check it often. 
Since tokens do not expire, it is up to the operator to 
[delete](/consul/commands/acl/token#delete) tokens 
that are not in use.

In the example output below, there are three tokens. The first token is created 
by Consul during the bootstrap process, called bootstrap token. The second token 
is user generated and was created with the `server-one-policy` policy. The third 
token is also created by Consul, but it has no privileges.

```shell-session
$ consul acl token list
AccessorID:       cf827c04-fb7d-ea75-da64-84e1dd2d5dfe
SecretID:         af410085-8bf6-80d6-08ad-2bfaa6526256
Description:      Bootstrap Token (Global Management)
Local:            false
Create Time:      2019-05-20 11:08:27.253096 -0500 CDT
Legacy:           false
Policies:
   00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 - global-management

AccessorID:       5d3c3a03-e627-a749-444c-2984101190c0
SecretID:         d203592e-3960-cf7e-801e-5b805825d359
Description:      token for server one
Local:            false
Create Time:      2019-10-17 11:46:27.106158 -0500 CDT
Legacy:           false
Policies:
   0bcee22c-6602-9dd6-b147-964958069426 - server-one-policy

AccessorID:       00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002
SecretID:         anonymous
Description:      Anonymous Token
Local:            false
Create Time:      2019-05-20 11:08:27.253959 -0500 CDT
Legacy:           false
```

The `consul acl token read` [command](/consul/commands/acl/policy/read) 
will provide information about the token specified. Ensure the privileges of the 
token are expected. This is useful when checking a node or service has the 
correct privileges to add itself to the catalog.

In the example output below includes the same information that is returned with 
the `consul acl token list` command, but is useful when you do not want to view 
all tokens.

```shell-session
$ consul acl token read -id 5d3c3a03-e627-a749-444c-2984101190c0
AccessorID:       5d3c3a03-e627-a749-444c-2984101190c0
SecretID:         547a969c-5dff-f9a8-6b84-fb1d23f9a5cb
Description:      token for server one
Local:            false
Create Time:      2019-10-17 11:46:27.106158 -0500 CDT
Policies:
   0bcee22c-6602-9dd6-b147-964958069426 - server-one-policy
```

Use the `consul acl token read` command first if the `consul catalog` or 
`consul members` commands return unexpected results.

## Reset the ACL system

If you encounter issues that are unresolvable, or misplace the bootstrap token, 
you can reset the ACL system by updating the index. First, find the leader by 
`curl`'ing the `/v1/status/leader` endpoint on any node. ACL reset must be 
performed on the leader.

```shell-session
$ curl 172.17.0.1:8500/v1/status/leader
"172.17.0.3:8300"%
```

In this example, you can verify that the leader is at IP `172.17.0.3`. The 
following commands need to be run on that server.

Re-run the bootstrap command to get the index number.

```shell-session
$ consul acl bootstrap
Failed ACL bootstrapping: Unexpected response code: 403 (Permission denied: ACL bootstrap no longer allowed (reset index: 13))
```

Then write the reset index into the bootstrap reset file: (here the reset index is 13)

```shell-session
$ echo 13 >> <data-directory>/acl-bootstrap-reset
```

After resetting the ACL system, you can initialize it again and recreate the 
bootstrap token.

### Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to use the Consul CLI to troubleshoot the ACL 
system. Each command has a corresponding [API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/acl).
 You also learned how to reset the the ACL system encase of emergency. Note, 
 resetting the ACL system will invalidate all tokens generated before the reset.
