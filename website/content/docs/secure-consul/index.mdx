# Secure Consul

This page describes tools and processes to secure Consul operations.

## Access control list (ACLs)

Consul provides an optional access control list (ACL) system that you can use to control access to data and APIs. Refer to the [ACLs documentation](/consul/docs/secure/acl) for more information.

## Encryption

The Consul agent supports encrypting all of its network traffic. There are two separate encryption systems, one for gossip traffic and one for HTTP and RPC. Refer to the [Encryption page](/consul/docs/secure/encryption) for more information.

## Security models

Requirements and recommendations for operating a secure Consul deployment may vary drastically depending on your intended workloads, operating system, and environment. Refer to [Security models](/consul/docs/secure-consul/security-model) to find detailed information about the various personas, recommendations, requirements, and threats.
