# Secure service mesh overview

This topic provides an overview for securing service-to-service communication within a service mesh using Consul. You can configure an mTLS certificate authority and intentions based on service identity to secure intra-mesh communication.

For information about gossip encryption and securing your Consul deployment with the Access Control List (ACL) system, refer to [Secure Consul](/consul/secure) in the Consul Operations section.

## Introduction

With Consul, a fully configured service mesh is one that enforces _zero-trust security_ by securing service-to-service communication in the following ways:

- Sidecar proxies encrypt and decrypt a service's traffic using an mTLS certificate signed by Consul
- Sidecar proxies deny incoming requests by default
- Sidecar proxies authorize incoming requests according to explicitly defined service intentions

## Certificate authority

## Service intentions

## Traffic Permissions

## Tutorials

- To learn more about the workflows described in this topic, refer to the following tutorials:
  - [Securely connect your services with Consul service mesh on VMs](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms/virtual-machine-gs-service-mesh)
  - [Securely connect your services with Consul service mesh on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/kubernetes-gs-service-mesh)
