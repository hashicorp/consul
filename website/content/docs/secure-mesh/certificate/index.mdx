# Service Mesh Certificate Authority overview

Service mesh certificate management is done centrally through the Consul
servers using the configured service mesh CA (Certificate Authority) provider. A CA provider
manages root and intermediate certificates and performs certificate signing
operations. The Consul leader orchestrates CA provider operations as necessary,
such as when a service needs a new certificate or during CA rotation events.

The CA provider abstraction enables Consul to support multiple systems for
storing and signing certificates. Consul ships with a
[built-in CA](/consul/docs/secure-mesh/certificate/built-in) which generates and stores the
root certificate and private key on the Consul servers. Consul also has
support for using
[Vault as a CA](/consul/docs/secure-mesh/certificate/vault). With Vault, the root certificate
and private key material remain with the Vault cluster.

## CA and Certificate relationship

This diagram shows the relationship between the CA certificates in a Consul primary datacenter and a
secondary Consul datacenter.

Leaf certificates are created for two purposes:
- the Leaf Cert Service is used by envoy proxies in the mesh to perform mTLS with other
services.
- the Leaf Cert Client Agent is created by auto-encrypt and auto-config. It is used by
client agents for HTTP API TLS, and for mTLS for RPC requests to servers.

Any secondary datacenters use their CA provider to generate an intermediate certificate
signing request (CSR) to be signed by the primary root CA. They receive an intermediate
CA certificate, which is used to sign leaf certificates in the secondary datacenter.

You can use different providers across primary and secondary datacenters.
For example, an operator may use a Vault CA provider for extra security in the primary
datacenter but choose to use the built-in CA provider in the secondary datacenter, which
may not have a reachable Vault cluster. The following table compares the built-in and Vault providers.

## CA Provider Comparison

|            | Consul built-in                    | Vault                                                                             |
|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security   | CA private keys are stored on disk | CA private keys are stored in Vault and are never exposed to Consul server agents |
| Resiliency | No dependency on external systems. If Consul is available, it can sign certificates | Dependent on Vault availability  |
| Latency    | Consul signs certificates locally  | A network call to Vault is required to sign certificates                          |

## CA Bootstrapping

CA initialization happens automatically when a new Consul leader is elected
as long as
[service mesh is enabled](/consul/docs/connect/configuration-entries#agent-configuration),
and the CA system has not already been initialized. This initialization process
will generate the initial root certificates and setup the internal Consul server
state.

For the initial bootstrap, the CA provider can be configured through the
[Agent configuration](/consul/docs/reference/agent#connect_ca_config). After
initialization, the CA can only be updated through the
[Update CA Configuration API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration).
If a CA is already initialized, any changes to the CA configuration in the
agent configuration file (including removing the configuration completely)
will have no effect.

If no specific provider is configured when service mesh is enabled, the built-in
Consul CA provider will be used and a private key and root certificate will
be generated automatically.

## Viewing Root Certificates

Root certificates can be queried with the
[list CA Roots endpoint](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#list-ca-root-certificates).
With this endpoint, you can see the list of currently trusted root certificates.
When a cluster first initializes, this will only list one trusted root. Multiple
roots may appear as part of
[rotation](#root-certificate-rotation).

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/connect/ca/roots
{
    "ActiveRootID": "31:6c:06:fb:49:94:42:d5:e4:55:cc:2e:27:b3:b2:2e:96:67:3e:7e",

    ]
}
```

## CA Configuration

After initialization, the CA provider configuration can be viewed with the
[Get CA Configuration API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#get-ca-configuration).
Consul will filter sensitive values from this endpoint depending on the
provider in use, so the configuration may not be complete.

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/connect/ca/configuration
{
    "Provider": "consul",
    "Config": {
        "LeafCertTTL": "72h",
        "IntermediateCertTTL": "8760h"
    },
    "CreateIndex": 5,
    "ModifyIndex": 5
}
```

The CA provider can be reconfigured using the
[Update CA Configuration API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration).
Specific options for reconfiguration can be found in the specific
CA provider documentation in the sidebar to the left.



### Recovering From Expired Certificates
If the built-in CA provider is misconfigured or unavailable, Consul service mesh requests eventually
stop functioning due to expiration of intermediate and root certificates. To recover manually, use the
[CLI helper](/consul/commands/tls/ca#consul-tls-ca-create) to generate CA certificates.


#### Example - Regenerating the built in CA
```shell-session
$ consul tls ca create -cluster-id test -common-name "Consul Agent CA" -days=365 -domain consul
  ==> Saved consul-agent-ca.pem
  ==> Saved consul-agent-ca-key.pem
```
The example above generates a new CA with a validity of 365 days. The cluster-id argument is specific
to each cluster and can be looked up by examining the `TrustDomain` field in
the [List CA Roots](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#list-ca-root-certificates) endpoint.

The contents of the generated cert and private key files from the above step should then be used with
the [Update CA Configuration](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#update-ca-configuration) endpoint. Once the CA configuration is
updated on the primary datacenter, all secondary datacenters will pick up the changes and regenerate their intermediate
and leaf certificates, after which any new requests that require certificate verification will succeed.
