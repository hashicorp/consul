# Rotate TLS certificates

This page describes

## Root certificate rotation

Whenever the CA's configuration is updated in a way that causes the root key to
change, a special rotation process will be triggered in order to smoothly
transition to the new certificate. This rotation is automatically orchestrated
by Consul.

~> If the current CA Provider doesn't support cross-signing, this process can't
be followed. See [Forced Rotation Without
Cross-Signing](#forced-rotation-without-cross-signing).

This also automatically occurs when a completely different CA provider is
configured (since this changes the root key). Therefore, this automatic rotation
process can also be used to cleanly transition between CA providers. For example,
updating the service mesh to use Vault instead of the built-in CA.

During rotation, an intermediate CA certificate is requested from the new root,
which is then cross-signed by the old root. This cross-signed certificate is
then distributed alongside any newly-generated leaf certificates used by the
proxies once the new root becomes active, and provides a chain of trust back to
the old root certificate in the event that a certificate signed by the new root
is presented to a proxy that has not yet updated its bundle of trusted root CA
certificates to include the new root.

After the cross-signed certificate has been successfully generated and the new root
certificate or CA provider has been set up, the new root becomes the active one
and is immediately used for signing any new incoming certificate requests.

If we check the [list CA roots
endpoint](/consul/api-docs/connect/ca#list-ca-root-certificates) after updating the
configuration with a new root certificate, we can see both the old and new root
certificates are present, and the currently active root has an intermediate
certificate which has been generated and cross-signed automatically by the old
root during the rotation process:

The old root certificate will be automatically removed once enough time has elapsed
for any leaf certificates signed by it to expire.

### Forced Rotation Without Cross-Signing

If the CA provider that is currently in use does not support cross-signing, then
attempts to change the root key or CA provider will fail. This is to ensure
operators don't make the change without understanding that there is additional
risk involved.

It is possible to force the change to happen anyway by setting the
`ForceWithoutCrossSigning` field in the CA configuration to `true`.

The downside is that all new certificates will immediately start being signed
with the new root key, but it will take some time for agents throughout the
cluster to observe the root CA change and reconfigure applications and proxies
to accept certificates signed by this new root. This will mean connections made
with a new certificate may fail for a short period after the CA change.

Typically all connected agents will have observed the new roots within seconds
even in a large deployment so the impact should be contained. But it is possible
for a disconnected, overloaded or misconfigured agent to not see the new root
for an unbounded amount of time during which new connections to services on that
host will fail. The issue will resolve as soon as the agent can reconnect to
servers.

Currently both Consul and Vault CA providers _do_ support cross signing. As more
providers are added this documentation will list any that this section applies
to.

## Rotate TLS certificates for Consul on Kubernetes

As of Consul Helm version `0.29.0`, if TLS is enabled, new TLS certificates for the Consul Server
are issued every time the Helm chart is upgraded. These certificates are signed by the same CA and will
continue to work as expected in the existing cluster.

Consul servers read the certificates from Kubernetes secrets during start-up and keep them in memory. In order to ensure the
servers use the newer certificate, the server pods need to be [restarted explicitly](/consul/docs/k8s/upgrade#upgrading-consul-servers) in
a situation where `helm upgrade` does not restart the server pods.

To explicitly perform server certificate rotation, follow these steps:

1. Perform a `helm upgrade`:

   ```shell-session
   $ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --values /path/to/my/values.yaml
   ```

   This should run the `tls-init` job that will generate new Server certificates.

1. Restart the Server pods following the steps [here](/consul/docs/k8s/upgrade#upgrading-consul-servers).
