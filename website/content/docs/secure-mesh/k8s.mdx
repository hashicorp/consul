# Secure service mesh overview

This topic provides an overview for securing service-to-service communication within a service mesh when running Consul on Kubernetes. You can configure an mTLS certificate authority and intentions based on service identity to secure intra-mesh communication.

For information about gossip encryption and securing your Consul deployment with the Access Control List (ACL) system, refer to [Secure Consul](/consul/secure) in the Consul Operations section.

## Introduction

With Consul, a fully configured service mesh is one that enforces _zero-trust security_ by securing service-to-service communication in the following ways:

- Sidecar proxies encrypt and decrypt a service's traffic using an mTLS certificate signed by Consul
- Sidecar proxies deny incoming requests by default
- Sidecar proxies authorize incoming requests according to explicitly defined service intentions

## Certificate authority

@include 'feature/certificate-authority.mdx'

## Service intentions

@include 'feature/service-intentions.mdx'

## Traffic Permissions

@include 'feature/v2/traffic-permissions.mdx'

## Tutorials

To learn more about the workflows described in this topic, refer to the [Securely connect your services with Consul service mesh on Kubernetes tutorial](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes/kubernetes-gs-service-mesh).

## Reference documentation

For reference material related to Consul's service mesh security options on Kubernetes, refer to the following pages:
