# Reroute HTTP requests

This topic describes how to configure routes attached to API gateways so that they filter HTTP requests and reroute the traffic to specific destinations. These instructions apply to service meshes running on Kubernetes. 

## Requirements

1. Verify that the [requirements](/consul/docs/access/api-gateway/tech-specs) have been met.
1. Verify that the Consul API Gateway CRDs and controller have been installed and applied. Refer to [Installation](/consul/docs/access/api-gateway/install) for details.

## Configuration

Specify the following fields in your `Route` configuration. Refer to the [Route configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes) for details about the parameters.

- [`rules.filters.type`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes#rules-filters-type): Set this parameter to `URLRewrite` to instruct Consul API Gateway to rewrite the URL when specific conditions are met.
- [`rules.filters.urlRewrite`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite): Specify the `path` configuration.
- [`rules.filters.urlRewrite.path`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes#rules-filters-urlrewrite-path): Contains the paths that incoming requests should be rewritten to based on the match conditions.

To configure the route to accept paths with or without a trailing slash, you must make two separate routes to handle each case.

### Example

In the following example, requests to` /incoming-request-prefix/` are forwarded to the `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/`. As a result, requests to `/incoming-request-prefix/request-path` are received by `backendRef` as `/prefix-backend-receives/request-path`.
