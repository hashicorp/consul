# API gateways overview

This topic provides overview information about API gateways in Consul. API gateways enable external network clients to access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter. Consul API gateways can also forward requests from clients to specific destinations based on path or request protocol.

## API gateway use cases

API gateways solve the following primary use cases:

- **Control access at the point of entry**: Set the protocols of external connection requests and secure inbound connections with TLS certificates from trusted providers, such as Verisign and Let's Encrypt.
- **Simplify traffic management**: Load balance requests across services and route traffic to the appropriate service by matching one or more criteria, such as hostname, path, header presence or value, and HTTP method.

## Workflows

You can deploy API gateways to networks that implement a variety of computing environments:

- Services hosted on VMs
- Kubernetes-orchestrated service containers
- Kubernetes-orchestrated service containers in OpenShift

The following steps describe the general workflow for deploying a Consul API gateways:

1. For Kubernetes-orchestrated services, install Consul on your cluster. For Kubernetes-orchestrated services on OpenShift, you must also enable the `openShift.enabled` parameter. Refer to [Install Consul on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/access/api-gateway/install) for additional information.
1. Define and deploy the API gateway configurations to create the API gateway artifacts. For VM-hosted services, create configuration entries for the gateway service, listeners configurations, and references to TLS certificates. For Kubernetes-orchestrated, configurations also include `GatewayClassConfig`s and `parametersRef`s.
1. Define and deploy routes between the gateway listeners and services in the mesh.

Gateway configurations are modular, so you can define and attach routes and inline certificates to multiple gateways.

## Technical specifications

Refer to [Technical specifications for API gateways on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/access/api-gateway/tech-specs) for additional details and considerations about using API gateways in Kubernetes-orchestrated networks.
