# Service mesh ingress on Kubernetes

This topic provides an overview of how Consul securely allows systems outside the service mesh to access services inside the mesh on Kubernetes. Network traffic that connects services inside the mesh to external clients or services is referred to as _north-south traffic_.

For information about enabling intra-mesh, or _east-west traffic_ , refer to [Link network segments overview](/consul/docs/link).

## Introduction

You can define points of ingress to the service mesh using either API gateways or ingress gateways. These gateways allow external network clients to access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter.

API gateways forward requests from clients to specific destinations based on path or request protocol. Ingress gateways are Consul's legacy capability for ingress and have been deprecated in favor of API gateways.

## API gateways

API gateways enable external network clients to securely access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter. Consul API gateways can also forward requests from clients to specific destinations in the service mesh based on request's path or protocol.


To enable an API gateway, you must configure the gateway, its listeners, and its routes. Refer to [API gateway overview](/consul/docs/access/api-gateway) for additional information about deploying API gateways to your Consul service mesh.

## Ingress gateways

Ingress gateways listen for external requests and route authorized traffic to instances in the service mesh. They provide one-way traffic from external sources to services in the mesh. If you want to enable traffic from services in the mesh to external destinations, then you must also configure a [terminating gateway](/consul/docs/register/external/terminating-gateway), which is a separate component that requires additional configuration and maintenance.

We recommend using API gateways to enable north-south traffic instead of implementing ingress gateways and terminating gateways.

Refer to [Ingress gateway overview](/consul/docs/access/ingress-gateway) for additional information about deploying ingress gateways to your Consul service mesh.

<Note>

Ingress gateways are deprecated. Use [Consul API gateways](/access/api-gateway) to secure service mesh ingressinstead.
