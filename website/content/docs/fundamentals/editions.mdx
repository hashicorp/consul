# Consul editions and tool binaries

This page describes the editions, binaries, and packages of Consul that are currently available. For a complete and up-to-date list of all HashiCorp releases, refer to [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/).

## Introduction

There are two main releases of Consul:

1. **Consul Community Edition (CE)**
1. **Consul Enterprise**

To run Consul Enterprise, you must configure Consul agents with an Enterprise license. The following table summarizes the major differences between Consul CE and Consul Enterprise:

## HCP Consul Dedicated

HCP Consul Dedicated is the networking software as a service (SaaS) product available through the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP). This service provides simplified workflows for common Consul tasks and the option to have HashiCorp set up and manage your Consul servers for you.

On November 12, 2025, HashiCorp will end operations and support for HCP Consul Dedicated clusters. After this date, you will no longer be able to deploy new Dedicated clusters, nor will you be able to access, update, or manage existing Dedicated clusters. Refer to [Migrate Consul Dedicated cluster to self-managed Enterprise](/hcp/docs/consul/migrate) for more information.

### Additional tool binaries and maintained repositories

The following is a list of Consul tools that were used by previous versions of Consul. Some tools may be useful when performing Consul updates with especially large release gaps, while others were deprecated entirely.

- `consul-api-gateway`. This feature was fully integrated into the `consul` package in v1.16.
- `consul-telemetry-collector`. This tool was developed to support [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/consul-central).

Consul also supports integrations with tools developed by our community. Refer to [Community tools](/consul/docs/integrate/consul-tools) for more information.

## Next steps

To continue learning about Consul and its fundamental operations, [download and install Consul](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install). Then [run a Consul agent in developer mode](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install/dev) so you can learn how to use the 3 main Consul interface: [Consul HTTP API](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/api), [Consul CLI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/cli), and [Consul web UI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/ui).
