# Deploy Consul client agent on Docker

This topic provides an overview for deploying a Consul client when running Consul on Docker containers.

## Deploy and run a Consul client

You deploy a containerized Consul client by running the `consul agent` command as a Docker container and instructing it to join the Consul cluster by giving it one of the Consul servers' hostname or IP address. Do not use detached mode, so you can reference the client logs during later steps.

```shell-session
$ docker run --name=consul-client hashicorp/consul consul agent -node=client-1 -data-dir=/consul/data -retry-join=172.17.0.2

In a new terminal, check that the client has joined by executing the `consul members` command in the Consul client container.

```shell-session
$  docker exec consul-client consul members
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
Node           Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-client  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <default>
```

The output shows that the client has joined the cluster and is ready to accept service registrations.
