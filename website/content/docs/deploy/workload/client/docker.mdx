# Deploy Consul client agent on Docker

This topic provides an overview for deploying a Consul client when running Consul on Docker containers.

## Deploy and run a Consul client

After you [deploy one or more server agents](/consul/docs/deploy/server/docker), you can deploy a containerized Consul client agent that joins the datacenter. Do not use detached mode. That way you can reference the client logs later.

The following command deploys a Docker container and instructs it to join the Consul cluster by including a Consul server's hostname or IP address in the `retry-join` parameter.

```shell-session
$ docker run --name=consul-client hashicorp/consul consul agent -node=consul-client -data-dir=/consul/data -retry-join=consul-server

In a new terminal session, run the `consul members` command in the Consul client container to confirm the agent joined the datacenter.

```shell-session
$  docker exec consul-client consul members
```

```plaintext hideClipboard
Node           Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-client  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <default>
```

The output confirms that the client joined the cluster, and is ready to accept service definitions.

## Multi-agent Consul deployment

You can start a multi-agent Consul deployment with multiple client containers. The following example uses a Docker compose file to start three Consul client containers that try to connect to a Consul server `consul-server1`. For more information about starting a Consul server cluster, see [Deploy Consul server agents on Docker](/docs/deploy/server/docker).

<CodeBlockConfig filename="consul-clients.yml">

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  consul-client1:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-client1
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    command: "agent -node=consul-client1 -client=0.0.0.0 -data-dir='/consul/data' -retry-join=consul-server1"
  consul-client2:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-client2
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    command: "agent -node=consul-client2 -client=0.0.0.0 -data-dir='/consul/data' -retry-join=consul-server1"
  consul-client3:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-client3
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    command: "agent -node=consul-client3 -client=0.0.0.0 -data-dir='/consul/data' -retry-join=consul-server1"
networks:
  consul:
    driver: bridge
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can start the cluster with the following command:

```shell-session
$ docker-compose -f consul-clients.yml up -d
[+] Running 4/4
 ✔ Network docker_consul     Created                                0.0s
 ✔ Container consul-client3  Started                                0.2s
 ✔ Container consul-client1  Started                                0.2s
 ✔ Container consul-client2  Started                                0.2s
```

This command starts the three Consul client containers in detached mode. Each client is configured to join the cluster by retrying to connect to `consul-server1`.

You can verify the status of the cluster by executing the `consul members` command inside any of the client containers:

```shell-session
$ docker exec consul-client1 consul members
Node            Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server1  172.19.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-client1  172.19.0.3:8301  alive   client  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <default>
consul-client2  172.19.0.4:8301  alive   client  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <default>
consul-client3  172.19.0.5:8301  alive   client  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <default>
```
