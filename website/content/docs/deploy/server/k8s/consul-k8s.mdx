# Install Consul on Kubernetes with the Consul K8s CLI

This topic describes how to install Consul on Kubernetes using the Consul K8s CLI (`consul-k8s`). The Consul K8s CLI lets you quickly install and interact with Consul on Kubernetes. Use the Consul K8s CLI tool to install Consul on Kubernetes if you are deploying a single cluster. 

We recommend using the [Helm chart installation method](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/helm) if you are installing Consul on Kubernetes for multi-cluster deployments that involve cross-partition or cross datacenter communication.

## Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to install Consul on Kubernetes with `consul-k8s`:

- `kubectl` configured to point to the Kubernetes cluster you want to install Consul on
- `consul-k8s` installed on your local machine. Refer to [Consul on Kubernetes CLI reference](/consul/docs/reference-cli/consul-k8s#install-the-cli) for instructions.

   <Note>

   You must install the correct version of the CLI for your Consul on Kubernetes deployment. To deploy a previous version of Consul on Kubernetes, download the specific version of the CLI that matches the version of the control plane that you would like to deploy. Refer to the [compatibility matrix](/consul/docs/k8s/compatibility) for details.

   </Note>


## Install Consul on Kubernetes

Issue the `install` subcommand to install Consul on your existing Kubernetes cluster. If you do not include any additional options, the `consul-k8s` CLI installs Consul on Kubernetes using the default settings from the Consul Helm chart values. 

You can specify options to configure your Consul install. For example, you can include the `-auto-approve` option set to `true` to proceed with the installation if the pre-install checks pass. Refer to the [Consul K8s CLI reference](/consul/docs/reference-cli/consul-k8s) for details about all commands and available options.

The following example installs Consul on Kubernetes with service mesh and CRDs enabled.

```shell-session
$ consul-k8s install 
==> Pre-Install Checks
No existing installations found.
 ✓ No previous persistent volume claims found
 ✓ No previous secrets found
==> Consul Installation Summary
   Installation name: consul
   Namespace: consul
   Overrides:
   connectInject:
      enabled: true

   Proceed with installation? (y/N) y

==> Running Installation
   ✓ Downloaded charts
--> creating 1 resource(s)
--> creating 45 resource(s)
--> beginning wait for 45 resources with timeout of 10m0s
   ✓ Consul installed into namespace "consul"
```

The pre-install checks may fail if existing `PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVC) are detected. Refer to the [uninstall instructions](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/uninstall) for information about removing PVCs.

## Custom installation

You can create a values file and specify parameters to overwrite the default Helm chart installation. Add the `-f` and specify your values file to implement your configuration, for example:

```shell-session
$ consul-k8s install -f values.yaml
``` 

### Install Consul on OpenShift clusters

[Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a security-conscious, opinionated wrapper for Kubernetes. To install Consul on OpenShift-managed Kubernetes, set `global.openshift.enabled=true` in your [custom installation](#custom-installation) values file:

```yaml
global:
  openshift:
    enabled: true
```

Refer to [`openshift` in the Helm chart reference](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/helm#v-global-openshift) for additional information.  

## Check the Consul cluster status

Issue the `consul-k8s status` command to view the status of the installed Consul cluster.

```shell-session
$ consul-k8s status

==> Consul-K8s Status Summary
   NAME  | NAMESPACE |  STATUS  | CHARTVERSION | APPVERSION | REVISION |      LAST UPDATED
---------+-----------+----------+--------------+------------+----------+--------------------------
   consul | consul    | deployed | 0.40.0       | 1.14.0     |        1 | 2022/01/31 16:58:51 PST

✓ Consul servers healthy (3/3)
✓ Consul clients healthy (3/3)
```
