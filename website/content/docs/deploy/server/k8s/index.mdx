# Deploy a Consul server on Kubernetes

This topic provides an overview for deploying a Consul server when running Consul on Kubernetes

## Basic deployments

To schedule a Consul server on a Kubernetes cluster, you can use either Helm or the Consul on Kubernetes CLI. Depending on your Kubernetes platform and cloud provider, there may be additional steps.

To get started, refer to the following topics:

- [Deploy Consul Community edition with Helm](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/helm)
- [Deploy Consul Enterprise with Helm](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/enterprise)
- [Deploy Consul with the `consul-k8s` CLI](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/consul-k8s)

Refer to the following platform deployment guides more specific information:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/aks)
- [AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/eks)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/gke)
- [Kind](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/kind)
- [Minikube](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/minikube)
- [Openshift](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/openshift)
- [Self-hosted](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/platform/self-hosted)

## Advanced deployments

You can configure Consul to run on Kubernetes clusters that are deployed in dispersed networks. Refer to the following topics for more information:

- [Deploy a single Consul datacenter across multiple Kubernetes clusters](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/multi-cluster)
- [Deploy Consul servers outside of Kubernetes](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/external)
- [Deploy Consul with Vault as Secrets backend](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/vault)
