# Deploy Consul server agent on Docker

This topic provides an overview for deploying a Consul server when running Consul on Docker containers.

## Deploy and run a Consul server

You can start a Consul server container and configure the Consul agent from the command line. 

The following example starts the Docker container and includes a `consul agent -server` sub-command to configure the Consul server agent and enable the UI.

```shell-session
$ docker run --name=consul-server -d -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:8600/udp hashicorp/consul consul agent -server -ui -node=server-1 -bootstrap-expect=1 -client=0.0.0.0 -data-dir=/consul/data
```

Since you started the container in detached mode, `-d`, the process will run in the background. You also set port mapping to your local machine as well as binding the client interface of our agent to 0.0.0.0. This allows you to work directly with the Consul datacenter from your local machine and to access Consul's UI and DNS over localhost. Finally, you are using Docker's default bridge network.

Note, the Consul Docker image sets up the Consul configuration directory at `/consul/config` by default. The agent will load any configuration files placed in that directory.

~> The configuration directory is **not** exposed as a volume and will not persist data. Consul uses it only during startup and does not store any state there.

 You can also submit a Consul configuration in JSON format with the environment variable `CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG`. This approach does not require mounting volumes or copying files to the container. For more information, refer to the [Consul on Docker documentation](/consul/docs/docker#consul-agent).

### Discover the server IP address

To find the IP address of the Consul server, execute the `consul members` command inside of the `consul-server` container.

```shell-session
$  docker exec consul-server consul members
Node      Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
server-1  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
```

## Multi-node Consul cluster

You can start a Consul cluster with multiple server containers that mimick more closely a production environment. The following example uses a Docker compose file to start three Consul server containers.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="consul-cluster.yml">

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  consul-server1:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-server1
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    ports:
      - "8500:8500"
      - "8600:8600/tcp"
      - "8600:8600/udp"
    command: "agent -server -ui -data-dir='/consul/data' -node=consul-server1 -retry-join=consul-server2 -bootstrap-expect=3"
  consul-server2:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-server2
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    command: "agent -server -ui -data-dir='/consul/data' -node=consul-server2 -retry-join=consul-server1 -bootstrap-expect=3"
  consul-server3:
    image: hashicorp/consul:1.21.3
    container_name: consul-server3
    restart: always
    networks:
      - consul
    command: "agent -server -ui -data-dir='/consul/data' -node=consul-server3 -retry-join=consul-server1 -bootstrap-expect=3"
networks:
  consul:
    driver: bridge
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can start the cluster with the following command:

```shell-session
$ docker-compose -f consul-cluster.yml up -d
[+] Running 4/4
 ✔ Network docker_consul     Created                                0.0s
 ✔ Container consul-server3  Started                                0.2s
 ✔ Container consul-server1  Started                                0.2s
 ✔ Container consul-server2  Started                                0.2s
```

This command starts the three Consul server containers in detached mode. Each server is configured to expect three servers in the cluster, which is specified by the `-bootstrap-expect=3` flag.

You can verify the status of the cluster by executing the `consul members` command inside any of the server containers:

```shell-session
$ docker exec consul-server1 consul members
Node            Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server1  172.19.0.2:8301  alive   server  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-server2  172.19.0.4:8301  alive   server  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-server3  172.19.0.3:8301  alive   server  1.21.3  2         dc1  default    <all>
```

You can also access the Consul UI by navigating to [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500) in your web browser, because in the Docker compose file the port `8500` on you local machine is forwarded to the `consul-server1` container.
