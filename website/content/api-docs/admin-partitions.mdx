| Response type | `application/json` |
| [Required ACLs] | `operator:write` |
| Corresponding CLI command | [`consul partition create`](/consul/commands/partition#create) |
| [Consistency modes] | N/A |

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - The partition name. This field must be a valid
  DNS hostname label.

- `Description` `(string: "")` - Free form partition description.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "Name": "na-west",
  "Description": "Partition for North America West"
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl ---request PUT \
   --header "X-Consul-Token: 5cdcae6c-0cce-4210-86fe-5dff3b984a6e" \

   http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/partition
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "Name": "na-west",
  "Description": "Partition for North America West",
  "CreateIndex": 55,
  "ModifyIndex": 55
}
```

This endpoint reads a partition with the given name and has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Value |

## Delete a Partition

This endpoint marks a partition for deletion. Once marked Consul will
deleted all the associated partitioned data in the background. Only once
all associated data has been deleted will the partition actually disappear.
Until then, further reads can be performed on the partition and a `DeletedAt`
field will now be populated with the timestamp of when the partition was
marked for deletion.

This endpoint has the following characteristics:

| Characteristic | Value |

| HTTP method | `DELETE` |

| Response type | none; success or failure is indicated by the HTTP response status code |
| [Required ACLs] | `operator:write` |
| Corresponding CLI command | [`consul partition delete`](/consul/commands/partition#delete) |
| [Consistency modes] | N/A |
| [Blocking queries] | N/A |
| [Agent caching] | N/A |

### Path Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the partition to delete.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl --request DELETE \
   --header "X-Consul-Token: b23b3cad-5ea1-4413-919e-c76884b9ad60" \
   http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/partition/na-west
```

### Sample Read Output After Deletion Prior to Removal

```json
{
  "Name": "na-west",
  "Description": "North America West Partition",
  "DeletedAt": "2021-12-14T23:00:00Z",
  "CreateIndex": 55,
