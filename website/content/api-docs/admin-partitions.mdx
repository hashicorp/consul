## Delete a Partition

This endpoint marks a Partition for deletion. Once marked Consul will
deleted all the associated partitioned data in the background. Only once
all associated data has been deleted will the Partition actually disappear.
Until then, further reads can be performed on the partition and a `DeletedAt`
field will now be populated with the timestamp of when the Partition was
marked for deletion.

| Method   | Path               | Produces |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| `DELETE` | `/partition/:name` | N/A      |

This endpoint will return no data. Success or failure is indicated by the status
code returned.

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api#authentication).

| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `operator:write` |

-> The corresponding CLI command is [`consul partition delete`](/commands/partition#delete).

### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the partition to delete. This
  is required and is specified as part of the URL path.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl -X DELETE \
   -H "X-Consul-Token: b23b3cad-5ea1-4413-919e-c76884b9ad60" \
