# Check - Agent HTTP API

Refer to [Define Health Checks](/consul/docs/services/usage/checks) for information about Consul health check capabilities.
The `/agent/check` endpoints interact with health checks
managed by the local agent in Consul.
These should not be confused with checks in the catalog.

## List Checks

This endpoint returns all checks that are registered with the local agent. These
checks were either provided through configuration files or added dynamically
using the HTTP API.

It is important to note that the checks known by the agent may be different from
those reported by the catalog. This is usually due to changes being made while
there is no leader elected. The agent performs active
[anti-entropy](/docs/architecture/anti-entropy), so in most situations
everything will be in sync within a few seconds.

| Method | Path            | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/agent/checks` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `node:read,service:read` |

### Query Parameters

- `filter` `(string: "")` - Specifies the expression used to filter the
  queries results prior to returning the data.

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Return only the checks in the specified namespace.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/checks
```

### Sample Response

## Register Check

This endpoint adds a new check to the local agent. Checks may be of script,
HTTP, TCP, UDP, or TTL type. The agent is responsible for managing the status of the
check and keeping the Catalog in sync.

| Method | Path                    | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/agent/check/register` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `node:write,service:write` |

### Query Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the check you register.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the check.

- `ID` `(string: "")` - Specifies a unique ID for this check on the node.
  This defaults to the `"Name"` parameter, but it may be necessary to provide an
  ID for uniqueness. This value will return in the response as `"CheckId"`.

- `Namespace` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the check you register.
  This field takes precedence over the `ns` query parameter,
  one of several [other methods to specify the namespace](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

- `Interval` `(string: "")` - Specifies the frequency at which to run this
  check. This is required for HTTP, TCP, and UDP checks.

- `Notes` `(string: "")` - Specifies arbitrary information for humans. This is
  not used by Consul internally.

- `DeregisterCriticalServiceAfter` `(string: "")` - Specifies that checks
  associated with a service should deregister after this time. This is specified
  as a time duration with suffix like "10m". If a check is in the critical state
  for more than this configured value, then its associated service (and all of
  its associated checks) will automatically be deregistered. The minimum timeout
  is 1 minute, and the process that reaps critical services runs every 30
  seconds, so it may take slightly longer than the configured timeout to trigger
  the deregistration. This should generally be configured with a timeout that's
  much, much longer than any expected recoverable outage for the given service.

- `Args` `(array<string>)` - Specifies command arguments to run to update the
  status of the check. Prior to Consul 1.0, checks used a single `Script` field
  to define the command to run, and would always run in a shell. In Consul
  1.0, the `Args` array was added so that checks can be run without a shell. The
  `Script` field is deprecated, and you should include the shell in the `Args` to
  run under a shell, eg. `"args": ["sh", "-c", "..."]`.

  -> **Note:** Consul 1.0 shipped with an issue where `Args` was erroneously named
  `ScriptArgs` in this API. Please use `ScriptArgs` with Consul 1.0 (that will
  continue to be accepted in future versions of Consul), and `Args` in Consul
  1.0.1 and later.

- `AliasNode` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of the node for an alias check.
  If no service is specified, the check will alias the health of the node.
  If a service is specified, the check will alias the specified service on
  this particular node.

- `AliasService` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of a service for an
  alias check. If the service is not registered with the same agent,
  `AliasNode` must also be specified. Note this is the service _ID_ and
  not the service _name_ (though they are very often the same).

- `DockerContainerID` `(string: "")` - Specifies that the check is a Docker
  check, and Consul will evaluate the script every `Interval` in the given
  container using the specified `Shell`. Note that `Shell` is currently only
  supported for Docker checks.

- `GRPC` `(string: "")` - Specifies a `gRPC` check's endpoint that supports the standard
  [gRPC health checking protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md).
  The state of the check will be updated at the given `Interval` by probing the configured
  endpoint. Add the service identifier after the `gRPC` check's endpoint in the following format to check for a specific service instead of the whole gRPC server `/:service_identifier`.

- `GRPCUseTLS` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether to use TLS for this `gRPC` health check.
  If TLS is enabled, then by default, a valid TLS certificate is expected. Certificate
  verification can be turned off by setting `TLSSkipVerify` to `true`.

- `H2PING` `(string "")` - Specifies an address that uses http2 to run a ping check on.
  At the specified `Interval`, a connection is made to the address, and a ping is sent.
  If the ping is successful, the check will be classified as `passing`, otherwise it will be marked as `critical`.
  TLS is used by default. To disable TLS and use h2c, set `H2PingUseTLS` to `false`.
  If TLS is enabled, a valid SSL certificate is required by default, but verification can be removed with `TLSSkipVerify`.

- `H2PingUseTLS` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if TLS should be used for H2PING check.
  If TLS is enabled, a valid SSL certificate is required by default, but verification can be removed with `TLSSkipVerify`.

- `HTTP` `(string: "")` - Specifies an `HTTP` check to perform a `GET` request
  against the value of `HTTP` (expected to be a URL) every `Interval`. If the
  response is any `2xx` code, the check is `passing`. If the response is `429 Too Many Requests`, the check is `warning`. Otherwise, the check is
  `critical`. HTTP checks also support SSL. By default, a valid SSL certificate
  is expected. Certificate verification can be controlled using the
  `TLSSkipVerify`.

- `Method` `(string: "")` - Specifies a different HTTP method to be used
  for an `HTTP` check. When no value is specified, `GET` is used.

- `Body` `(string: "")` - Specifies a body that should be sent with `HTTP` checks.

- `DisableRedirects` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether to disable following HTTP
  redirects when performing an HTTP check.

- `Header` `(map[string][]string: {})` - Specifies a set of headers that should
  be set for `HTTP` checks. Each header can have multiple values.

- `Timeout` `(duration: 10s)` - Specifies a timeout for outgoing connections in the
  case of a Script, HTTP, TCP, UDP, or gRPC check. Can be specified in the form of "10s"
  or "5m" (i.e., 10 seconds or 5 minutes, respectively).

- `OutputMaxSize` `(positive int: 4096)` - Allow to put a maximum size of text
  for the given check. This value must be greater than 0, by default, the value
  is 4k.
  The value can be further limited for all checks of a given agent using the
  `check_output_max_size` flag in the agent.

- `TLSServerName` `(string: "")` - Specifies an optional string used to set the
  SNI host when connecting via TLS.
  For an `HTTP` check, this value is set automatically if the URL uses a hostname
  (not an IP address).

- `TLSSkipVerify` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if the certificate for an HTTPS
  check should not be verified.

- `TCP` `(string: "")` - Specifies a `TCP` to connect against the value of `TCP`
  (expected to be an IP or hostname plus port combination) every `Interval`. If
  the connection attempt is successful, the check is `passing`. If the
  connection attempt is unsuccessful, the check is `critical`. In the case of a
  hostname that resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, an attempt will be
  made to both addresses, and the first successful connection attempt will
  result in a successful check.

- `UDP` `(string: "")` - Specifies a `UDP` IP address/hostname and port.
The check sends datagrams to the value specified at the interval specified in the `Interval` configuration.
If the datagram is sent successfully or a timeout is returned, the check is set to the `passing` state.
The check is logged as `critical` if the datagram is sent unsuccessfully.

- `OSService` `(string: "")` - Specifies the identifier of an OS-level service to check. You can specify either `Windows Services` on Windows or `SystemD` services on Unix.

- `TTL` `(duration: 10s)` - Specifies this is a TTL check, and the TTL endpoint
  must be used periodically to update the state of the check. If the check is not
  set to passing within the specified duration, then the check will be set to the failed state.

- `ServiceID` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of a service to associate the
  registered check with an existing service provided by the agent.

- `Status` `(string: "")` - Specifies the initial status of the health check.

- `SuccessBeforePassing` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of consecutive successful
  results required before check status transitions to passing. Available for HTTP,
  TCP, gRPC, Docker & Monitor checks. Added in Consul 1.7.0.

- `FailuresBeforeWarning` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of consecutive unsuccessful
  results required before check status transitions to warning. Defaults to the same value
  as `FailuresBeforeCritical`. Values higher than `FailuresBeforeCritical` are invalid.
  Available for HTTP, TCP, gRPC, Docker & Monitor checks. Added in Consul 1.11.0.

- `FailuresBeforeCritical` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of consecutive unsuccessful
  results required before check status transitions to critical. Available for HTTP,
  TCP, gRPC, Docker & Monitor checks. Added in Consul 1.7.0.

```

## Methods to Specify Namespace <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Local agent health check endpoints
support several methods for specifying the namespace of the check resources
with the following order of precedence:
1. `Namespace` field of the JSON request body -
  only applies to the [register](#register-check) endpoint
1. `ns` query parameter
1. `X-Consul-Namespace` request header
1. Namespace is inherited from the namespace of the request's ACL token (if any)
1. The `default` namespace
