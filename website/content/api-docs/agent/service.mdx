# Service - Agent HTTP API

The `/agent/service` endpoints interact with services on the local agent in
Consul. These should not be confused with services in the catalog.

## List Services

This endpoint returns all the services that are registered with
the local agent. These services were either provided through configuration files
or added dynamically using the HTTP API.

It is important to note that the services known by the agent may be different
from those reported by the catalog. This is usually due to changes being made
while there is no leader elected. The agent performs active
[anti-entropy](/consul/docs/architecture/anti-entropy), so in most situations
everything will be in sync within a few seconds.

| Method | Path              | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/agent/services` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `service:read` |

### Query Parameters

- `filter` `(string: "")` - Specifies the expression used to filter the
  queries results prior to returning the data.

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Return only the services in the specified namespace.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/services
```

### Sample Response

## Get Service Configuration

This endpoint was added in Consul 1.3.0 and returns the full service definition
for a single service instance registered on the local agent. It is used by
[service mesh proxies](/consul/docs/connect/proxies) to discover the embedded proxy
configuration that was registered with the instance.

It is important to note that the services known by the agent may be different
from those reported by the catalog. This is usually due to changes being made
while there is no leader elected. The agent performs active
[anti-entropy](/consul/docs/architecture/anti-entropy), so in most situations
everything will be in sync within a few seconds.

| Method | Path                         | Produces           |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/agent/service/:service_id` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries  | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `YES`<sup>1</sup> | `none`            | `none`        | `service:read` |

<sup>
  1
</sup> Supports <a href="/api/features/blocking#hash-based-blocking-queries">
  hash-based blocking
</a> only.

### Path Parameters

- `service_id` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the ID of the service to fetch.

### Query Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you lookup.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

The following example request calls the `web-sidecar-proxy` service:

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/service/web-sidecar-proxy
```

### Sample Response

The response contains the fields specified in the [service
definition](/consul/docs/services/configuration/services-configuration-reference), but it includes an extra `ContentHash` field that contains the [hash-based blocking
query](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking#hash-based-blocking-queries) hash for the result. The
same hash is also present in `X-Consul-ContentHash`.

    ]
  }
}
```

## Get local service health

Retrieve an aggregated state of service(s) on the local agent by name.

This endpoints support JSON format and text/plain formats, JSON being the
default. In order to get the text format, you can append `?format=text` to
the URL or use Mime Content negotiation by specifying a HTTP Header
`Accept` starting with `text/plain`.

| Method | Path                                                   | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/agent/health/service/name/:service_name`             | `application/json` |
| `GET`  | `/agent/health/service/name/:service_name?format=text` | `text/plain`       |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `service:read` |

Those endpoints return the aggregated values of all health checks for the
service instance(s) and will return the corresponding HTTP codes:

| Result | Meaning                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | All health checks of every matching service instance are passing |
| `400`  | Bad parameter (missing service name of id)                       |
| `404`  | No such service id or name                                       |
| `429`  | Some health checks are passing, at least one is warning          |
| `503`  | At least one of the health checks is critical                    |

Those endpoints might be useful for the following use-cases:

- a load-balancer wants to check IP connectivity with an agent and retrieve
  the aggregated status of given service
- create aliases for a given service (thus, the health check of alias uses
  http://localhost:8500/v1/agent/service/id/aliased_service_id health check)

##### Note

If you know the ID of service you want to target, it is recommended to use
[`/v1/agent/health/service/id/:service_id`](/consul/api-docs/agent/service#get-local-service-health-by-id)
so you have the result for the service only. When requesting
`/v1/agent/health/service/name/:service_name`, the caller will receive the
worst state of all services having the given name.

### Path Parameters

- `service_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the service to retrieve.

### Query Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you lookup.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Requests

Given 2 services with name `web`, with web2 critical and web1 passing:

#### List the worst status across all instances of the `web` service (HTTP 503)

##### By Name, Text

```shell-session
$ curl "http://localhost:8500/v1/agent/health/service/name/web?format=text"
critical
```

##### By Name, JSON

For the JSON output, the response is an array containing the details of each
passing, warning, or critical service.

```shell
curl localhost:8500/v1/agent/health/service/name/web
```

## Register Service

This endpoint adds a new service, with optional health checks, to the local
agent.

The agent is responsible for managing the status of its local services, and for
sending updates about its local services to the servers to keep the global
catalog in sync.

For "connect-proxy" kind services, the `service:write` ACL for the
`Proxy.DestinationServiceName` value is also required to register the service.

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `service:write` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul services register`](/consul/commands/services/register).

### Query Parameters

- `replace-existing-checks` - Missing health checks from the request will be deleted from the agent. Using this parameter allows to idempotently register a service and its checks without having to manually deregister checks.

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you register.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### JSON Request Body Schema

The `/agent/service/register` endpoint supports camel case and _snake case_ for service definition keys. Snake case is a convention in which keys with two or more words have underscores between them. Snake case ensures compatibility with the agent configuration file format.

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the logical name of the service.
  Many service instances may share the same logical service name. We recommend using
  valid DNS labels for service definition names. Refer to the Internet Engineering Task Force's [RFC 1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123#page-72) for additional information. Service names that conform to standard usage ensures compatibility with external DNSs. Refer to [Services Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/services/configuration/services-configuration-reference#name) for additional information.

- `ID` `(string: "")` - Specifies a unique ID for this service. This must be
  unique per _agent_. This defaults to the `Name` parameter if not provided.

- `Tags` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies a list of tags to assign to the
  service. Tags enable you to filter when querying for the services and are exposed in Consul APIs. We recommend using
  valid DNS labels for tags. Refer to the Internet Engineering Task Force's [RFC 1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123#page-72) for additional information. Tags that conform to standard usage ensures compatibility with external DNSs. Refer to [Services Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/services/configuration/services-configuration-reference#tags) for additional information.

- `Address` `(string: "")` - Specifies the address of the service. If not
  provided, the agent's address is used as the address for the service during
  DNS queries.

- `TaggedAddresses` `(map<string|object>: nil)` - Specifies a map of explicit LAN
  and WAN addresses for the service instance. Both the address and port can be
  specified within the map values.

- `Meta` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - Specifies arbitrary KV metadata
  linked to the service instance.

- `Namespace` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you register.
  This field takes precedence over the `ns` query parameter,
  one of several [other methods to specify the namespace](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

- `Port` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the port of the service.

- `Kind` `(string: "")` - The kind of service. Defaults to `""`, which is a
  typical Consul service. You can specify the following values: 
  - `"connect-proxy"` for [service mesh](/consul/docs/connect) proxies representing another service
  - `"mesh-gateway"` for instances of a [mesh gateway](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway#service-mesh-proxy-configuration)
  - `"terminating-gateway"` for instances of a [terminating gateway](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/terminating-gateway)
  - `"ingress-gateway"` for instances of a [ingress gateway](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/ingress-gateway)

- `Proxy` `(Proxy: nil)` - From 1.2.3 on, specifies the configuration for a
  service mesh proxy instance. This is only valid if `Kind` defines a proxy or gateway.
  See the [Proxy documentation](/consul/docs/connect/registration/service-registration)
  for full details.

- `Connect` `(Connect: nil)` - Specifies the
  [configuration for service mesh](/consul/docs/connect/configuration). The connect subsystem provides Consul's service mesh capabilities. Refer to the
  [Connect Structure](#connect-structure) section below for supported fields.

- `Check` `(Check: nil)` - Specifies a check. Please see the
  [check documentation](/consul/api-docs/agent/check) for more information about the
  accepted fields. If you don't provide a name or id for the check then they
  will be generated. To provide a custom id and/or name set the `CheckID`
  and/or `Name` field.

- `Checks` `(array<Check>: nil)` - Specifies a list of checks. Please see the
  [check documentation](/consul/api-docs/agent/check) for more information about the
  accepted fields. If you don't provide a name or id for the check then they
  will be generated. To provide a custom id and/or name set the `CheckID`
  and/or `Name` field. The automatically generated `Name` and `CheckID` depend
  on the position of the check within the array, so even though the behavior is
  deterministic, it is recommended for all checks to either let consul set the
  `CheckID` by leaving the field empty/omitting it or to provide a unique value.

- `EnableTagOverride` `(bool: false)` - Specifies to disable the anti-entropy
  feature for this service's tags. If `EnableTagOverride` is set to `true` then
  external agents can update this service in the [catalog](/consul/api-docs/catalog)
  and modify the tags. Subsequent local sync operations by this agent will
  ignore the updated tags. For instance, if an external agent modified both the
  tags and the port for this service and `EnableTagOverride` was set to `true`
  then after the next sync cycle the service's port would revert to the original
  value but the tags would maintain the updated value. As a counter example, if
  an external agent modified both the tags and port for this service and
  `EnableTagOverride` was set to `false` then after the next sync cycle the
  service's port _and_ the tags would revert to the original value and all
  modifications would be lost.

- `Weights` `(Weights: nil)` - Specifies weights for the service. Refer to 
  [Services Configuration Reference](/consul/docs/services/configuraiton/services-configuration-reference#weights) for additional information. Default is
  `{"Passing": 1, "Warning": 1}`.

  Weights only apply to the locally registered service. 
  If multiple nodes register the same service, each node implements `EnableTagOverride` and other service configuration items independently. Updating the tags for the service registered
  on one node does not necessarily update the same tags on services with the same name registered on another node. If `EnableTagOverride` is not specified the default value is
  `false`. See [anti-entropy syncs](/consul/docs/architecture/anti-entropy) for
  additional information.

#### Connect Structure

For the `Connect` field, the parameters are:

- `Native` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether this service supports
  the [Consul service mesh](/consul/docs/connect) protocol [natively](/consul/docs/connect/native).
  If this is true, then service mesh proxies, DNS queries, etc. will be able to
  service discover this service.
- `Proxy` `(Proxy: nil)` -
  **Deprecated** Specifies that a managed service mesh proxy should be started 
  for this service instance, and optionally provides configuration for the proxy. 
  Managed proxies (which have been deprecated since Consul v1.3.0) have been 
  [removed](/consul/docs/connect/proxies) since v1.6.0.
- `SidecarService` `(ServiceDefinition: nil)` - Specifies an optional nested
  service definition to register. For more information see
  [Sidecar Service Registration](/consul/docs/connect/registration/sidecar-service).

```

## Deregister Service

This endpoint removes a service from the local agent. If the service does not
exist, no action is taken.

The agent will take care of deregistering the service with the catalog. If there
is an associated check, that is also deregistered.

| Method | Path                                    | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/agent/service/deregister/:service_id` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `service:write` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul services deregister`](/consul/commands/services/deregister).

### Path Parameters

- `service_id` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the ID of the service to deregister.

### Query Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you deregister.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/service/deregister/my-service-id
```

## Enable Maintenance Mode

This endpoint places a given service into "maintenance mode". During maintenance
mode, the service will be marked as unavailable and will not be present in DNS
or API queries. This API call is idempotent. Maintenance mode is persistent and
will be automatically restored on agent restart.

| Method | Path                                     | Produces           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/agent/service/maintenance/:service_id` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `service:write` |

### Path Parameters

- `service_id` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the ID of the service to put in maintenance mode.

### Query Parameters

- `enable` `(bool: <required>)` - Specifies whether to enable or disable
  maintenance mode. This is specified as part of the URL as a query string
  parameter.

- `reason` `(string: "")` - Specifies a text string explaining the reason for
  placing the node into maintenance mode. This is simply to aid human operators.
  If no reason is provided, a default value is used instead.
  This parameter must be URI-encoded.

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the namespace of the service you place into maintenance mode.
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/service/maintenance/my-service-id?enable=true&reason=For+the+docs
```

## Methods to Specify Namespace <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Local agent service endpoints
support several methods for specifying the namespace of service resources
with the following order of precedence:
1. `Namespace` field of the JSON request body -
  only applies to the [register](#register-check) endpoint
1. `ns` query parameter
1. `X-Consul-Namespace` request header
1. Namespace is inherited from the namespace of the request's ACL token (if any)
1. The `default` namespace
