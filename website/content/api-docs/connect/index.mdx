# Connect HTTP Endpoint

The `/connect` endpoints provide access to
[service mesh-related](/consul/docs/connect) operations for
intentions and the certificate authority.

There are also service mesh-related endpoints in the
[Agent](/consul/api-docs/agent) and [Catalog](/consul/api-docs/catalog) APIs. For example,
the API for requesting a TLS certificate for a service is part of the agent
APIs. And the catalog API has an endpoint for finding all mesh-capable
services in the catalog.

The noun _connect_ is used throughout this documentation to refer to the connect
subsystem that provides Consul's service mesh capabilities.
Where you encounter the _noun_ connect, it is usually functionality specific to
service mesh.
