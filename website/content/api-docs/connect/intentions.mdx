# Intentions - Connect HTTP API

The `/connect/intentions` endpoint provide tools for managing
[intentions](/docs/connect/intentions).

-> **1.9.0 and later:** Reading and writing intentions has been
migrated to the
[`service-intentions`](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions)
config entry kind.

## Upsert Intention by Name ((#upsert-intention-by-name))

-> **1.9.0+:** This API is available in Consul versions 1.9.0 and later.

This endpoint creates a new intention and returns `true` if it was created
successfully.

The name and destination pair must be unique. If another intention matches the
name and destination, the creation will replace the previous intention.

~> The intentions created by this endpoint will not be assigned the following
fields: `ID`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`. Additionally, the `Meta` field cannot
be persisted using this endpoint and will require editing the enclosing
`service-intentions` config entry for the destination.

| Method | Path                        | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/connect/intentions/exact` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `intentions:write`<sup>1</sup> |

  <sup>1</sup> Intention ACL rules are specified as part of a{' '}

  for more details.

### URL Parameters

- `source` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the source service. This
  is specified as part of the URL.
  This can take [several forms](/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `destination` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the destination service. This
  is specified as part of the URL.
  This can take [several forms](/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the default
  namespace to use when `source` or `destination` parameters lack namespaces.
  If not provided, the default namespace will be inherited from the
  request's ACL token or will default to the `default` namespace.
  This value may be provided by either the `ns` URL query parameter or in the
  `X-Consul-Namespace` header.
  Added in Consul 1.9.0.

### PUT Body Parameters

- `SourceType` `(string: "")` - The type for the `SourceName` value.
  This can be only "consul" today to represent a Consul service. If not
  provided, this will be defaulted to "consul".

- `Action` `(string: "")` - For an L4 intention this is required, and should be
  set to one of "allow" or "deny" for the action that should be taken if
  this intention matches a request.

  This should be omitted for an L7 intention as it is mutually exclusive with
  the `Permissions` field.

- `Permissions` `(array<IntentionPermission>)` - The list of all [additional L7
  attributes](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions#intentionpermission)
  that extend the intention match criteria.

  Permission precedence is applied top to bottom. For any given request the
  first permission to match in the list is terminal and stops further
  evaluation. As with L4 intentions, traffic that fails to match any of the
  provided permissions in this intention will be subject to the default
  intention behavior is defined by the default [ACL
  policy](/docs/agent/options#acl_default_policy).

  This should be omitted for an L4 intention as it is mutually exclusive with
  the `Action` field.

- `Description` `(string: "")` - Description for the intention. This is not
  used by Consul, but is presented in API responses to assist tooling.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "SourceType": "consul",
  "Action": "allow"
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/connect/intentions/exact?source=web&destination=db
```

### Sample Response

```json
true
```

## Create Intention with ID

-> **Deprecated** - This endpoint is deprecated in Consul 1.9.0 in favor of
[upserting by name](#upsert-intention-by-name) or editing the
[`service-intentions`](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entry for the destination.

This endpoint creates a new intention and returns its ID if it was created
successfully.

The name and destination pair must be unique. If another intention matches
the name and destination, the creation will fail. You must either update the
existing intention or delete it prior to creating a new one.

| Method | Path                  | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/connect/intentions` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking),

  </a>{' '}
  for more details.
</p>

### URL Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the default
  namespace to use when `SourceNS` or `DestinationNS` are omitted or empty.
  If not provided, the default namespace will be inherited from the
  request's ACL token or will default to the `default` namespace.
  This value may be provided by either the `ns` URL query parameter or in the
  `X-Consul-Namespace` header.
  Added in Consul 1.9.0.

### POST Body Parameters

- `SourceName` `(string: <required>)` - The source of the intention.
  For a `SourceType` of `consul` this is the name of a Consul service. The
  service doesn't need to be registered.

- `SourceNS` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - The namespace for the
  `SourceName` parameter.

- `DestinationName` `(string: <required>)` - The destination of the intention.
  The intention destination is always a Consul service, unlike the source.
  The service doesn't need to be registered.

- `DestinationNS` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - The namespace for the
  `DestinationName` parameter.

- `SourceType` `(string: "")` - The type for the `SourceName` value.
  This can be only "consul" today to represent a Consul service. If not
  provided, this will be defaulted to "consul".

- `Action` `(string: <required>)` - This is one of "allow" or "deny" for
  the action that should be taken if this intention matches a request.

- `Description` `(string: "")` - Description for the intention. This is not
  used by Consul, but is presented in API responses to assist tooling.

- `Meta` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - Specifies arbitrary KV metadata pairs.

### Sample Payload

{
  "SourceName": "web",
  "DestinationName": "db",

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request DELETE \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/connect/intentions/e9ebc19f-d481-42b1-4871-4d298d3acd5c
```

## Check Intention Result

This endpoint evaluates the intentions for a specific source and destination
and returns whether the connection would be authorized or not given the current
Consul configuration and set of intentions.

-> **Note:** This endpoint will always evaluate intentions with `Permissions`
defined as _deny_ intentions during. This endpoint is only suited for
networking layer 4 (e.g. TCP) integration.

For performance and reliability reasons it is desirable to implement intention
enforcement by listing [intentions that match the
destination](/api/connect/intentions#list-matching-intentions) and representing
them in the native configuration of the proxy itself (such as RBAC for Envoy).

This endpoint will work even if the destination service has
`intention = "deny"` specifically set, because the resulting API response
does not contain any information about the intention itself.

| Method | Path                        | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/connect/intentions/check` | `application/json` |

### Parameters

- `by` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies whether to match the "name" value
  by "source" or "destination".

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies a name to match. This parameter
  can be repeated for batching multiple matches.
  This can take [several forms](/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the default
  namespace to use when `name` parameter lacks namespaces.
  If not provided, the default namespace will be inherited from the
  request's ACL token or will default to the `default` namespace.
  This value may be provided by either the `ns` URL query parameter or in the
  `X-Consul-Namespace` header.
  Added in Consul 1.9.0.
