# Intentions - Connect HTTP API

The `/connect/intentions` endpoint provide tools for managing
[intentions](/consul/docs/connect/intentions).

-> **1.9.0 and later:** Reading and writing intentions has been
migrated to the
[`service-intentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions)
config entry kind.

## Upsert Intention by Name ((#upsert-intention-by-name))

-> **1.9.0+:** This API is available in Consul versions 1.9.0 and later.

This endpoint creates a new intention and returns `true` if it was created
successfully.

The name and destination pair must be unique. If another intention matches the
name and destination, the creation will replace the previous intention.

~> The intentions created by this endpoint will not be assigned the following
fields: `ID`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`. Additionally, the `Meta` field cannot
be persisted using this endpoint and will require editing the enclosing
`service-intentions` config entry for the destination.

| Method | Path                        | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/connect/intentions/exact` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `intentions:write` <p> Define intention rules in the `service` policy. Refer to [ACL requirements for intentions](/consul/docs/connect/intentions/create-manage-intentions#acl-requirements) for additional information.</p> |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul intention create -replace`](/consul/commands/intention/create#replace).

### Query Parameters

- `source` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the source service
  according to the [source naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `destination` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the destination service
  according to the [destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the default namespace
  to use when `source` or `destination` query parameters do not include a namespace
  as shown in the [source and destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `SourceType` `(string: "")` - The type for the `SourceName` value.
  This can be only "consul" today to represent a Consul service. If not
  provided, this will be defaulted to "consul".

- `Action` `(string: "")` - For an L4 intention this is required, and should be
  set to one of "allow" or "deny" for the action that should be taken if
  this intention matches a request.

  This should be omitted for an L7 intention as it is mutually exclusive with
  the `Permissions` field.

- `Permissions` `(array<IntentionPermission>)` - The list of all [additional L7
  attributes](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions#intentionpermission)
  that extend the intention match criteria.

  Permission precedence is applied top to bottom. For any given request the
  first permission to match in the list is terminal and stops further
  evaluation. As with L4 intentions, traffic that fails to match any of the
  provided permissions in this intention will be subject to the default
  intention behavior is defined by the default [ACL
  policy](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#acl_default_policy).

  This should be omitted for an L4 intention as it is mutually exclusive with
  the `Action` field.

- `Description` `(string: "")` - Description for the intention. This is not
  used by Consul, but is presented in API responses to assist tooling.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "SourceType": "consul",
  "Action": "allow"
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data @payload.json \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/connect/intentions/exact?source=web&destination=db"
```

### Sample Response

```json
true
```

## Create Intention with ID

-> **Deprecated** - This endpoint is deprecated in Consul 1.9.0 in favor of
[upserting by name](#upsert-intention-by-name) or editing the
[`service-intentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entry for the destination.

This endpoint creates a new intention and returns its ID if it was created
successfully.

The name and destination pair must be unique. If another intention matches
the name and destination, the creation will fail. You must either update the
existing intention or delete it prior to creating a new one.

| Method | Path                  | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/connect/intentions` | `application/json` |

### Query Parameters

- `ns` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the default namespace
  to use when `SourceNS` or `DestinationNS` request body parameters do not include a namespace
  as shown in the [source and destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `SourceName` `(string: <required>)` - The source of the intention.
  For a `SourceType` of `consul` this is the name of a Consul service. The
  service does not need to be registered.

- `SourceNS` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - The namespace for the
  `SourceName` parameter.

- `DestinationName` `(string: <required>)` - The destination of the intention.
  The intention destination is always a Consul service, unlike the source.
  The service does not need to be registered.

- `DestinationNS` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - The namespace for the
  `DestinationName` parameter.

- `SourceType` `(string: "")` - The type for the `SourceName` value.
  This can be only "consul" today to represent a Consul service. If not
  provided, this will be defaulted to "consul".

- `Action` `(string: <required>)` - This is one of "allow" or "deny" for
  the action that should be taken if this intention matches a request.

- `Description` `(string: "")` - Description for the intention. This is not
  used by Consul, but is presented in API responses to assist tooling.

- `Meta` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - Specifies arbitrary KV metadata pairs.

## Delete Intention by ID

-> **Deprecated** - This endpoint is deprecated in Consul 1.9.0 in favor of
[deleting by name](#delete-intention-by-name) or editing the
[`service-intentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entry for the destination.

This endpoint deletes a specific intention.

| Method   | Path                        | Produces           |

```

## Check Intention Result

This endpoint evaluates the intentions for a specific source and destination
and returns whether the connection would be authorized or not given the current
Consul configuration and set of intentions.

-> **Note:** This endpoint will always evaluate intentions with `Permissions`
defined as _deny_ intentions during. This endpoint is only suited for
networking layer 4 (e.g. TCP) integration.

For performance and reliability reasons it is desirable to implement intention
enforcement by listing [intentions that match the
destination](/consul/api-docs/connect/intentions#list-matching-intentions) and representing
them in the native configuration of the proxy itself (such as RBAC for Envoy).

This endpoint will work even if the destination service has
`intention = "deny"` specifically set, because the resulting API response
does not contain any information about the intention itself.

| Method | Path                        | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul intention check`](/consul/commands/intention/check).

### Query Parameters

- `source` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the source service
  according to the [source naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

- `destination` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the destination service
  according to the [destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

  to use when `source` or `destination` query parameters do not include a namespace
  as shown in the [source and destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/connect/intentions/check?source=web&destination=db"
```

  to use when the `name` query parameter does not include a namespace
  as shown in the [source and destination naming conventions](/consul/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).
  You can also [specify the namespace through other methods](#methods-to-specify-namespace).

## Methods to Specify Namespace <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Intention endpoints
support several methods for specifying the namespace of intention resources
with the following order of precedence:
1. `ns` query parameter
1. `X-Consul-Namespace` request header
1. Namespace is inherited from the namespace of the request's ACL token (if any)
1. The `default` namespace
