# Network Segments - Operator HTTP API

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `/operator/segment` endpoint provides tools to manage network segments via
Consul's HTTP API.

The network area functionality described here is available only in
[Consul Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/) version 0.9.3 and
later. Network segments are operator-defined sections of agents on the LAN, typically
isolated from other segments by network configuration.

Please check the [Network Segments documentation](/consul/docs/enterprise/network-segments/network-segments-overview) for more details.
