# Autopilot Operator HTTP API

The `/operator/autopilot` endpoints allow for automatic operator-friendly
management of Consul servers including cleanup of dead servers, monitoring
the state of the Raft cluster, and stable server introduction.

Please check the [Autopilot tutorial](/consul/tutorials/datacenter-operations/autopilot-datacenter-operations) for more details.

## Read Configuration

This endpoint retrieves its latest Autopilot configuration.

| Method | Path                                | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/operator/autopilot/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `operator:read` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul operator autopilot get-config`](/consul/commands/operator/autopilot#get-config).

### Query Parameters

- `dc` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter to query. This will default to
  the datacenter of the agent being queried.

- `stale` `(bool: false)` - If the cluster does not currently have a leader an
  error will be returned. You can use the `?stale` query parameter to read the
  Raft configuration from any of the Consul servers.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/operator/autopilot/configuration
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "CleanupDeadServers": true,
  "LastContactThreshold": "200ms",
  "MaxTrailingLogs": 250,
  "ServerStabilizationTime": "10s",
  "RedundancyZoneTag": "",
  "DisableUpgradeMigration": false,
  "UpgradeVersionTag": "",
  "CreateIndex": 4,
  "ModifyIndex": 4
}
```

For more information about the Autopilot configuration options, see the
[agent configuration section](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#autopilot).

## Update Configuration

This endpoint updates the Autopilot configuration of the cluster.

| Method | Path                                | Produces           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/operator/autopilot/configuration` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required     |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `operator:write` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul operator autopilot set-config`](/consul/commands/operator/autopilot#set-config).

### Query Parameters

- `dc` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter to query. This will default to
  the datacenter of the agent being queried.

- `cas` `(int: 0)` - Specifies to use a Check-And-Set operation. The update will
  only happen if the given index matches the `ModifyIndex` of the configuration
  at the time of writing.

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `CleanupDeadServers` `(bool: true)` - Specifies automatic removal of dead
  server nodes periodically and whenever a new server is added to the cluster.

- `LastContactThreshold` `(string: "200ms")` - Specifies the maximum amount of
  time a server can go without contact from the leader before being considered
  unhealthy. Must be a duration value such as `10s`.

- `MaxTrailingLogs` `(int: 250)` specifies the maximum number of log entries
  that a server can trail the leader by before being considered unhealthy.

- `MinQuorum` `(int: 0)` - specifies the minimum number of servers needed before
  Autopilot can prune dead servers.

- `ServerStabilizationTime` `(string: "10s")` - Specifies the minimum amount of
  time a server must be stable in the 'healthy' state before being added to the
  cluster. Only takes effect if all servers are running Raft protocol version 3
  or higher. Must be a duration value such as `30s`.

- `RedundancyZoneTag` `(string: "")` - Controls the node-meta key to use when
  Autopilot is separating servers into zones for redundancy. Only one server in
  each zone can be a voting member at one time. If left blank, this feature will
  be disabled.

- `DisableUpgradeMigration` `(bool: false)` - Disables Autopilot's upgrade
  migration strategy in Consul Enterprise of waiting until enough
  newer-versioned servers have been added to the cluster before promoting any of
  them to voters.

- `UpgradeVersionTag` `(string: "")` - Controls the node-meta key to use for
  version info when performing upgrade migrations. If left blank, the Consul
  version will be used.

```

- `Healthy` is whether all the servers are currently healthy.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of redundant healthy servers that could be
  fail without causing an outage (this would be 2 in a healthy cluster of 5
  servers).

- `Servers` holds detailed health information on each server:

  - `ID` is the Raft ID of the server.

  - `Name` is the node name of the server.

  - `Address` is the address of the server.

  - `SerfStatus` is the SerfHealth check status for the server.

  - `Version` is the Consul version of the server.

  - `Leader` is whether this server is currently the leader.

  - `LastContact` is the time elapsed since this server's last contact with the leader.

  - `LastTerm` is the server's last known Raft leader term.

  - `LastIndex` is the index of the server's last committed Raft log entry.

  - `Healthy` is whether the server is healthy according to the current Autopilot configuration.

  - `Voter` is whether the server is a voting member of the Raft cluster.

  - `StableSince` is the time this server has been in its current `Healthy` state.

  The HTTP status code will indicate the health of the cluster. If `Healthy` is true, then a
  status of 200 will be returned. If `Healthy` is false, then a status of 429 will be returned.

- `Healthy` is whether all the servers are currently healthy.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of redundant healthy servers that could be
  fail without causing an outage (this would be 2 in a healthy cluster of 5
  servers).
- `OptimisticFailuretolerance` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is the maximum number
  of servers that could fail in the right order over the right period of time
  without causing an outage. This value is only useful when using the [Redundancy
  Zones feature](/consul/docs/enterprise/redundancy) with autopilot.

- `Servers` is a mapping of server ID to an object holding detailed information about that server.
  The format of the detailed info is documented in its own section.

- `Leader` is the server ID of current leader. This value can be used as an index into the `Servers` object.

- `Voters` is a list of server IDs that are voters. These values can be used as indexes into the `Servers` object.

- `RedundancyZones` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is mapping of redundancy zone name to redundancy zone information.
  The format of the redundancy zone information is documented in its own section.

- `ReadReplicas` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is a list of server IDs that autopilot has identified as read replicas.
  These will never be promoted. These values can be used as indexes into the `Servers` map.
- `Upgrade` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is an object holding all the information about any ongoing automated upgrade.
  The format of this object is detailed in its own section.

### Server Response Format

```json
{
  "ID": "1c3e3278-3f88-4a97-9f6a-1058584e8058",
  "Name": "node1",
  "Address": "198.18.0.1:8300",
  "NodeStatus": "alive",
  "Version": "1.9.0+ent",
  "LastContact": "1.321ms",
  "LastTerm": 4,
  "LastIndex": 42,
  "Healthy": true,
  "StableSince": "2020-08-12T12:13:14Z",
  "RedundancyZone": "az1",
  "UpgradeVersion": "1.2.3",
  "ReadReplica": false,
  "Status": "voter",
  "Meta": {
    "build": "1.2.3",
    "zone": "az1"
  },
  "NodeType": "redundancy-zone-voter"
}
```

- `ID` is the Raft ID of the server.

- `Name` is the node name of the server.

- `Address` is the address of the server.

- `NodeStatus` is the SerfHealth check status for the server.

- `Version` is the Consul version of the server.

- `LastContact` is the time elapsed since this server's last contact with the leader.

- `LastTerm` is the server's last known Raft leader term.

- `LastIndex` is the index of the server's last committed Raft log entry.

- `Healthy` is whether the server is healthy according to the current Autopilot configuration.

- `StableSince` is the time this server has been in its current `Healthy` state.
- `RedundancyZone` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is the name of the redundancy zone this server is within.
- `UpgradeVersion` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> is the version that will be used for automated upgrade calculations.
- `ReadReplica` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> indicates whether this server is a read replica or not.
- `Status` indicates the current Raft status of this server. Possible values are:
  `leader`, `voter`, `non-voter`, or `staging`.
- `Meta` is the node metadata of this server. Values within this map are used for determining a server's
  redundancy zone and upgrade version.
- `NodeType` is the desired type autopilot thinks this server should have. In Consul OSS the only possible
  value is `voter` as all present servers should having voting rights. In Consul Enterprise the possible values also
  include `read-replica`, `zone-voter`, `zone-standby` and `zone-extra-voter`. `zone-voter` indicates that autopilot
  wants this server to be the voter for a particular redundancy zone. When a zone has no voter all nodes will be typed
  as this until one is promoted. When that happens the other non-voters in the zone will be typed as `zone-standby`.
  This indicates that they are currently desired to be standby servers in case the voter from the zone fails. Finally,
  the `zone-extra-voter` status indicates that autopilot wants this server to be a voter due to a failure of all servers
  in another zone and that when one of the servers in that failed zone are restored, this server will be demoted.

### Redundancy Zone Response Format <EnterpriseAlert inline />

```json
{
  "Servers": [
    "10b71f14-4b08-4ae5-840c-f86d39e7d330",
    "b007061c-6d15-4c90-b3d6-2fef276a0650"
  ],
  "Voters": ["b007061c-6d15-4c90-b3d6-2fef276a0650"],
  "FailureTolerance": 1
}
```

Each zone in the responses `RedundancyZones` mapping will have this structure.

- `Servers` is a list of server IDs of all the servers in this zone. These values can be used as indexes
  into the top level response's `Servers` mapping.
- `Voters` is a list of server IDs of all servers in this zone that have voting rights. Typically this will
  be a list with 1 value but in some failure scenarios or upgrade scenarios the size could increase. These
  values can be used as indexes into the top level response's `Servers` mapping.

- `FailureTolerance` is the number of servers in this zone that could fail without causing a total zone failure
  and subsequent promotion of a server from another zone as a fallback.
