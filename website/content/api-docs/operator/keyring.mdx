# Keyring Operator HTTP API

The `/operator/keyring` endpoints allow for management of the gossip encryption
keyring. Please see the [Gossip Protocol Guide](/docs/architecture/gossip) for
more details on the gossip protocol and its use.

## List Gossip Encryption Keys

This endpoint lists the gossip encryption keys installed on both the WAN and LAN
rings of every known datacenter, unless otherwise specified with the `local-only`
query parameter (see below).

If ACLs are enabled, the client will need to supply an ACL Token with `keyring`
read privileges.

| Method | Path                | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/operator/keyring` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `keyring:read` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul keyring -list`](/commands/keyring#list).

### Query Parameters

- `relay-factor` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the relay factor. Setting this to a
  non-zero value will cause nodes to relay their responses through this many
  randomly-chosen other nodes in the cluster. The maximum allowed value is `5`.

- `local-only` `(bool: false)` - Setting `local-only` to true will force keyring
  list queries to only hit local servers (no WAN traffic). This flag can only be set
  for list queries.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/operator/keyring
```

### Sample Response

```json
[
  {
    "WAN": true,
    "Datacenter": "dc1",
    "Segment": "",
    "Keys": {
      "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=": 1,
      "ZWTL+bgjHyQPhJRKcFe3ccirc2SFHmc/Nw67l8NQfdk=": 1,
      "WbL6oaTPom+7RG7Q/INbJWKy09OLar/Hf2SuOAdoQE4=": 1
    },
    "PrimaryKeys": {
      "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=": 1
    },
    "NumNodes": 3
  },
  {
    "WAN": false,
    "Datacenter": "dc1",
    "Segment": "",
    "Keys": {
      "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=": 1,
      "ZWTL+bgjHyQPhJRKcFe3ccirc2SFHmc/Nw67l8NQfdk=": 1,
      "WbL6oaTPom+7RG7Q/INbJWKy09OLar/Hf2SuOAdoQE4=": 1
    },
    "PrimaryKeys": {
      "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s=": 1
    },
    "NumNodes": 3
  }
]
```

- `WAN` is true if the block refers to the WAN ring of that datacenter (rather
  than LAN).

- `Datacenter` is the datacenter the block refers to.

- `Segment` is the network segment the block refers to.

- `Keys` is a map of each gossip key to the number of nodes it's currently
  installed on.

- `PrimaryKeys` is a map of each primary gossip key to the number of nodes it's currently
  installed on.

- `NumNodes` is the total number of nodes in the datacenter.

## Add New Gossip Encryption Key

This endpoint installs a new gossip encryption key into the cluster.

| Method | Path                | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `POST` | `/operator/keyring` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `keyring:write` |

The corresponding CLI command is [`consul keyring -install`](/commands/keyring#install).

### Query Parameters

- `relay-factor` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the relay factor. Setting this to a
  non-zero value will cause nodes to relay their responses through this many
  randomly-chosen other nodes in the cluster. The maximum allowed value is `5`.

### JSON Request Body Schema

- `Key` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the encryption key to install into
  the cluster.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "Key": "pUqJrVyVRj5jsiYEkM/tFQYfWyJIv4s3XkvDwy7Cu5s="
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/operator/keyring
```

## Change Primary Gossip Encryption Key

This endpoint changes the primary gossip encryption key. The key must already be
installed before this operation can succeed.
