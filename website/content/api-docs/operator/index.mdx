# Operator HTTP Endpoint

The `/operator` endpoints provide cluster-level tools for Consul operators,
such as interacting with the Raft subsystem. For a CLI to perform these
operations manually, please check the documentation for the
[`consul operator`](/consul/commands/operator) command.

If ACLs are enabled then a token with operator privileges may be required in
order to use this interface. Check the [ACL Rules documentation](/consul/docs/security/acl/acl-rules#operator-rules)
for more information.

Check the [Disaster recovery for Consul clusters](/consul/tutorials/datacenter-operations/recovery-outage) tutorial for some examples of
how these capabilities are used.

Please choose a sub-section in the navigation for more information.
