# Consul Peering Establish

Command: `consul peering establish`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[POST\] /v1/peering/establish](/consul/api-docs/peering#establish-a-peering-connection)

The `peering establish` starts a peering connection with the cluster that generated the peering token.
You can generate cluster peering tokens using the [`consul peering generate-token`](/consul/commands/peering/generate-token) command or the [HTTP API](/consul/api-docs/peering#generate-a-peering-token).

You can only use a peering token to establish the connection once. If you need to reestablish a peering connection, you must generate a new token.
