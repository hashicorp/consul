# Consul Catalog List Services

Command: `consul catalog services`

The `catalog services` command prints all known services. It can also query
for services that match particular metadata or list the services that a
particular node provides.

consul
postgresql
redis
```

Show all services with their tags:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog services -tags
consul
postgresql  leader
redis       primary,v1
```

List services for the node "worker-01":

```shell-session
$ consul catalog services -node=worker-01
consul
redis
```
