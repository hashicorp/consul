# Consul Catalog

Command: `consul catalog`

The `catalog` command is used to interact with Consul's catalog via the command
line. It exposes top-level commands for reading and filtering data from the
registry.

The catalog is also accessible via the [HTTP API](/api-docs/catalog).

## Basic Examples

List all datacenters:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog datacenters
dc1
dc2
dc3
```

List all nodes:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog nodes
Node       ID        Address    DC
worker-01  1b662d97  10.4.5.31  dc1
```

List all nodes which provide a particular service:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog nodes -service=redis
Node       ID        Address     DC
worker-01  1b662d97  10.4.5.31   dc1
worker-02  d407a592  10.4.4.158  dc1
```

List all services:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog services
consul
postgresql
redis
```

List all services on a node:

```shell-session
$ consul catalog services -node=worker-01
consul
postgres
```
