# Consul Namespace

Command: `consul namespace`

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `namespace` command provides management of Consul Enterprise namespaces. This was added in Consul Enterprise 1.7.0.

If ACLs are enabled then a token with operator privileges may be required in order to use this command. Write
requests are forwarded to the leader in the primary datacenter. Therefore these commands can be run against
any agent in any datacenter.

## Usage

Usage: `consul namespace <subcommand>`

For the exact documentation for your Consul version, run `consul namespace -h` to view the complete list of subcommands.
