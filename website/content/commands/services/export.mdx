# Consul Services Export

Command: `consul services export`

The services export subcommand is used to export a service from one admin partition
or cluster peer to another. This is accomplished by creating or updating the corresponding
`exported-services` configuration entry. Running the command multiple times with the same
arguments will result in a no-op.

```text
Usage: consul services export [options] -name <service name> -consumer-peers <other cluster name>

  Export a service to a peered cluster.

      $ consul services export -name=web -consumer-peers=other-cluster

  Use the -consumer-partitions flag instead of -consumer-peers to export to a different partition in the same cluster.

      $ consul services export -name=web -consumer-partitions=other-partition

  Additional flags and more advanced use cases are detailed below.
```

#### Command Options

- `-name=<string>` - (Required) The name of the service to export.

- `-consumer-peers=<string>` - (Required) A comma-separated list of cluster peers to export the service to.
  In Consul Enterprise, this flag is optional if -consumer-partitions is specified.

#### Enterprise Options

- `-consumer-partitions=<string>` - A comma-separated list of admin partitions within the
  same datacenter to export the service to. This flag is optional if -consumer-peers is specified.

## Examples

The example below shows using the `export` command to export the `web` service to a cluster
peer named `dc2`.

```shell-session hideClipboard
$ consul services export -name=web -consumer-peers=dc2
```

The example below shows using the `export` command to export the `web` service located in the
namespace `ns1` and the admin partition `part1` to other admin partitions named `part2` and `part3`.

```shell-session hideClipboard
$ consul services export -name=web -namespace=ns1 -partition=part1 -consumer-partitions=part2,part3
```
