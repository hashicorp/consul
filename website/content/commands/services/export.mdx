# Consul Services Export

Command: `consul services export`

The services export subcommand is used to export a service from one admin partition
or cluster peer to another.

Usage: consul services export [options] -name <service name> -consumer-peers <other cluster name>

  Export a service to a peered cluster.

      $ consul services export -name=web -consumer-peers=other-cluster

  Use the -consumer-partitions flag instead of -consumer-peers to export to a different partition in the same cluster.
