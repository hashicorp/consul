# Consul Snapshot

Command: `consul snapshot`

The `snapshot` command has subcommands for saving, restoring, and inspecting the
state of the Consul servers for disaster recovery. These are atomic, point-in-time
snapshots which include key/value entries, service catalog, prepared queries,
sessions, and ACLs. This command is available in Consul 0.7.1 and later.

Snapshots are also accessible via the [HTTP API](/api/snapshot).

## Usage
