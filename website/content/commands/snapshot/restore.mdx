# Consul Snapshot Restore

Command: `consul snapshot restore`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[PUT\] /v1/snapshot](/api-docs/snapshot#restore-snapshot)

The `snapshot restore` command is used to restore an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Consul servers which includes key/value entries,
service catalog, prepared queries, sessions, and ACLs. The snapshot is read
from the given file.

Restores involve a potentially dangerous low-level Raft operation that is not
designed to handle server failures during a restore. This command is primarily
intended to be used when recovering from a disaster, restoring into a fresh
cluster of Consul servers.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/api#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/api/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.

| ACL Required |
| ------------ |
| `management` |

## Usage

#### API Options

Please see the [HTTP API](/api/snapshot) documentation for
more details about snapshot internals.
