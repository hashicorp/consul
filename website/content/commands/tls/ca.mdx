# Consul TLS CA Create

Command: `consul tls ca create`

This command creates a self-signed CA to be used for Consul TLS setup.

## Example

Create a CA:

```shell-session
$ consul tls ca create
==> Saved consul-ca.pem
==> Saved consul-ca-key.pem
```

Create a CA which only signs certificates for example.com

```shell-session
$ consul tls ca create -name-constraint -domain example.com
==> Saved example.com-ca.pem
==> Saved example.com-ca-key.pem
```

## Usage

Usage: `consul tls ca create [options]`

#### Command Options

- `-additional-name-constraint=<value>` - Add name constraints for the CA.
  Results in rejecting certificates for other DNS than specified. Can be used
  multiple times. Only used in combination with `-name-constraint`.

- `-days=<int>` - Provide number of days for which the CA will be valid. Defaults to 5 years.

- `-domain=<string>` - Domain of consul cluster. Only used when `-name-constraint` is set. Defaults to consul.
  Additional domains can be passed with `-additional-name-constraint`.

- `-name-constraint` - Enables [X.509 Name Constraints](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#page-40) for the CA.
  If used, the CA will only sign certificates for localhost and the domains specified by `-domain` and `-additional-name-constraint`.
  If the UI will be served over HTTPS its DNS name should be added with `-additional-constraint`. Defaults to false.

- `cluster-id` - ClusterID of the consul cluster. Sets the CA's URI with the SPIFFEID of the cluster and domain.

- `common-name` - Common Name of CA. Defaults to Consul Agent CA.
