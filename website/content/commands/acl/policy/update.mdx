# Consul ACL Policy Update

Command: `consul acl policy update`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[PUT\] /v1/acl/policy/:id](/consul/api-docs/acl/policies#update-a-policy)

The `acl policy update` command is used to update a policy. The default operations is to merge the current policy
with those values provided to the command invocation. Therefore to update just one field, only
the `-id` or `-name` options and the option to modify must be provided. Note that renaming
policies requires both the `-id` and `-name` as the new name cannot yet be used to lookup the
policy.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.

## Usage

Usage: `consul acl policy update [options] [args]`

#### Command Options

- `-description=<string>` - A description of the policy.

- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the policy to update. It may be specified as a
  unique ID prefix but will error if the prefix matches multiple policy IDs

- `-meta` - Indicates that policy metadata such as the content hash and raft
  indices should be shown for each entry

- `-name=<string>` - The policy's name.

- `-no-merge` - Do not merge the current policy information with what is provided
  to the command. Instead overwrite all fields with the exception of
  the policy ID which is immutable.

- `-rules=<string>` - The policy rules. May be prefixed with `@` to indicate that
  the value is a file path to load the rules from. `-` may also be given to
  indicate that the rules are available on stdin.

~> Specifying `-rules` will overwrite existing rules.

- `-valid-datacenter=<value>` - Datacenter that the policy should be valid within.
  This flag may be specified multiple times.

- `-format={pretty|json}` - Command output format. The default value is `pretty`.
