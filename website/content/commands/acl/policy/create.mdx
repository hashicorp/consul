# Consul ACL Policy Create

Command: `consul acl policy create`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[PUT\] /v1/acl/policy](/consul/api-docs/acl/policies#create-a-policy)

The `acl policy create` command creates new policies.

The `-rules` parameter value allow loading the value from stdin, a file or the raw value.
To use stdin pass `-` as the value. To load the value from a file prefix the value with an `@`. Any other
values will be used directly.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.

## Examples

Create a new policy that is valid in all datacenters:

```shell-session
$ consul acl policy create -name "acl-replication" -description "Policy capable of replicating ACL policies" -rules 'acl = "read"'
ID:           35b8ecb0-707c-ee18-2002-81b238b54b38
Name:         acl-replication
Description:  Policy capable of replicating ACL policies
Datacenters:
Rules:
acl = "read"
```

Create a new policy valid only in specific datacenters with rules read from a file:

```shell-session
$ consul acl policy create -name "replication" -description "Replication" -rules @rules.hcl -valid-datacenter dc1 -valid-datacenter dc2
ID:           ca44555b-a2d8-94de-d763-88caffdaf11f
Name:         replication
Description:  Replication
Datacenters:  dc1, dc2
Rules:
acl = "read"
service_prefix "" {
   policy = "read"
   intentions = "read"
}
```
