# Consul ACL Templated Policies

Command: `consul acl templated-policy`

Use the `acl templated-policy` command  to manage templated ACL policies.
It exposes commands for reading, previewing, and listing templated policies.

You can also manage ACL templated policies using the [/`templated-policies` HTTP API endpoint](/consul/api-docs/acl/templated-policies).

All of the example subcommands require a valid Consul token with the appropriate permissions. Either set the `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable to the token's secret ID or pass the
secret ID as the value of the `-token` parameter.
