# Consul ACL Templated Policies

Command: `consul acl templated-policy`

The `acl templated-policy` command is used to manage Consul's ACL templated policies.
It exposes commands for reading, previewing and listing templated policies.
This command is available in Consul 1.17.0 and newer.

ACL policies may also be managed via the [HTTP API](/consul/api-docs/acl/templated-policies).

-> **Note:** All of the example subcommands in this document will require a valid
Consul token with the appropriate permissions. Either set the
`CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable to the token's secret ID or pass the
secret ID as the value of the `-token` parameter.
