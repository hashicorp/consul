# Consul ACLs

Command: `consul acl`

The `acl` command is used to interact with Consul's ACLs via the command
line. It exposes top-level commands for bootstrapping the ACL system,
managing tokens and policies, translating legacy rules, and setting the
tokens for use by an agent.

ACLs are also accessible via the [HTTP API](/api-docs/acl).

Bootstrap Consul's ACLs:

```shell-session
$ consul acl bootstrap
AccessorID:   4d123dff-f460-73c3-02c4-8dd64d136e01
SecretID:     86cddfb9-2760-d947-358d-a2811156bf31
Description:  Bootstrap Token (Global Management)
Local:        false
Create Time:  2018-10-22 11:27:04.479026 -0400 EDT
Policies:
   00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 - global-management
```

Create a policy:

```shell-session
$ consul acl policy create -name "acl-replication" -description "Token capable of replicating ACL policies" -rules 'acl = "read"'
ID:           35b8ecb0-707c-ee18-2002-81b238b54b38
Name:         acl-replication
Description:  Token capable of replicating ACL policies
Datacenters:
Rules:
acl = "read"
```

Create a token:

```shell-session
$ consul acl token create -description "Agent Policy Replication - my-agent" -policy-name "acl-replication"
AccessorID:   c24c11aa-4e08-e25c-1a67-705a2e8d75a4
SecretID:     e7024f9c-f016-02dd-6217-daedbffb86ac
Description:  Agent Policy Replication - my-agent
Local:        false
Create Time:  2018-10-22 11:34:49.960482 -0400 EDT
Policies:
