It will be removed in a future major release when support for the legacy ACL system is removed.

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[GET\] /v1/acl/rules/translate/:accessor_id](/api-docs/acl#translate-a-legacy-token-s-rules)

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of

| ACL Required |
| ------------ |
| `acl:read`   |

### Usage

Usage: `consul acl translate-rules [options] TRANSLATE`

#### Command Options

- `TRANSLATE` - The rules to translate. If `-` is used, then
  the rules will be read from stdin. If `@` is prefixed to
  the value then the value is considered to be a file and
  the rules will be read from that file.

- `-token-secret` - Specifies that what the `TRANSLATE` argument
  holds is not a rule set but rather the token secret ID of a
  legacy ACL token that holds the rule set.

- `-token-accessor` - Specifies that what the `TRANSLATE` argument
  holds is not a rule set but rather the token accessor ID of a
  legacy ACL token that holds the rule set.

#### API Options

@include 'http_api_options_client.mdx'

@include 'http_api_options_server.mdx'

### Examples

Translate rules within a file:

```shell-session
$ consul acl translate-rules @rules.hcl
```

Translate rules from stdin:

```shell-session
$ consul acl translate-rules -
```

Translate rules from a string argument:

```shell-session
$ consul acl translate-rules 'key "" { policy = "write"}'
```

Translate rules for a legacy ACL token using its SecretID passed from stdin:

```shell-session
$ consul acl translate-rules --token-secret -
```

Translate rules for a legacy ACL token using its AccessorID:

```shell-session
$ consul acl translate-rules 429cd746-03d5-4bbb-a83a-18b164171c89
