# Consul KV

Command: `consul kv`

The `kv` command is used to interact with Consul's KV store via the
command line. It exposes top-level commands for inserting, updating, reading,
and deleting from the store. This command is available in Consul 0.7.1 and
later.

The KV store is also accessible via the
[HTTP API](/api-docs/kv).

## Usage

Usage: `consul kv <subcommand>`

For the exact documentation for your Consul version, run `consul kv -h` to view
the complete list of subcommands.

    get       Retrieves or lists data from the KV store
    import    Imports part of the KV tree in JSON format

## Basic Examples

To create or update the key named "redis/config/connections" to the value "5" in
Consul's KV store:

```shell-session
$ consul kv put redis/config/connections 5
Success! Data written to: redis/config/connections
```

To read a value back from Consul:

```shell-session
$ consul kv get redis/config/connections
5
```

Or you can query for detailed information:

```shell-session
$ consul kv get -detailed redis/config/connections
CreateIndex      336
Flags            0
Key              redis/config/connections
LockIndex        0
ModifyIndex      336
Session          -
Value            5
```

Finally, deleting a key is just as easy:

```shell-session
$ consul kv delete redis/config/connections
Success! Data deleted at key: redis/config/connections
```
