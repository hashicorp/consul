# Consul Admin Partition

Command: `consul partition`

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `partition` command enables you to create and manage Consul Enterprise administrative or admin partitions. Admin partitions are boundaries that allow multiple tenants to exist independently of each other on a shared set of Consul servers. This feature is currently in beta.

If ACLs are enabled then a token with operator privileges may be required in order to use this command.

You should only run the `partition` command in the primary datacenter.

## Usage

```shell-session
consul partition <SUBCOMMAND> <OPTIONS>
```

Issue the `consul partition -h` command to view the subcommands.

```shell-session
Usage: consul partition <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for interacting with Consul Enterprise
  admin partitions. Here are some simple examples. More detailed
  examples are available in the subcommands or the documentation.

  Create an admin partition

    $ consul partition create -name team1

  Create or Update an admin partition from its full definition:

    $ consul partition write part1

  Read an admin partition:

    $ consul partition read team1

  List all admin partitions:

    $ consul partition list

  Update an admin partition

    $ consul partition update -name team1 -description "first partition"

  Delete an admin partition:

    $ consul partition delete team1

  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.
```

## Subcommands

You can issue the following subcommands with the `consul partition` command.

### `create`

The `create` subcommand sends a request to the server to create a new admin partition.

```shell-session
consul partition create <OPTIONS>
```

The admin partition is created according to the values specified in the options. You can specify the following options:

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `-name` | String value that specifies the name for the new partition. | none | Required |
| `-description` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | String value that specifies a description of the new partition. | none | Optional |
| `-format` | Specifies how to format the output of the operation in the console. | none | Optional |
| `-show-meta` | Prints the description and raft indices to the console in the response. <br/> This option does not take a value. Include the option when issuing the command to enable. | Disabled | Optional |

In the following example, a partition named `webdev` is created:

```shell-session
consul partition create -name "webdev" -description "Partition for admin of webdev services" -format  json -show-meta

{
   "Name": "webdev",
   "Description": "Partition for admin of webdev services",
   "CreateIndex": 940,
   "ModifyIndex": 940
}
```

### `write`

The `write` subcommand sends a request to the server to create a new admin partition or update an existing partition from its full definition. You can specify an admin partition definition file or use values from `stdin`.

Use the following syntax to write from file:

```shell-session
consul partition write <OPTIONS> <FILE>
```

Use the following syntax to write from `stdin`:

```shell-session
consul partition write <OPTIONS> -
```

The definition file or `stdin` values can be provided in JSON or HCL format. Refer to the  [Admin Partition Definition](#partition-definition) section for details about the supported parameters.

You can specify the following options:

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `-format` | Specifies how to format the output of the operation in the console. | none | Optional |
| `-show-meta` &nbsp; &nbsp; | Prints the description and raft indices to the console in the response. <br/> This option does not take a value. Include the option when issuing the command to enable. | Disabled | Optional |

In the following example, the `webdev-bu` partition is written using `stdin` values:

```shell-session
consul partition write -format  json -show-meta - <<< 'name = "webdev-bu" description = "backup webdev partition"'

{
   "Name": "webdev-bu",
   "Description": "backup webdev partition",
   "CreateIndex": 1462,
   "ModifyIndex": 1462
}
```

### `read`

The `read` subcommand sends a request to the server to read the configuration for the specified partition and print it to the console.

```shell-session
consul partition read <OPTIONS> <PARTITION_NAME>
```

The admin partition is created according to the values specified in the options. You can specify the following options:

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `-format` &nbsp; &nbsp; | Specifies how to format the output of the operation in the console. | none | Optional |
| `-meta` | Prints the description and raft indices to the console in the response. <br/> This option does not take a value. Include the option when issuing the command to enable. | Disabled | Optional |

In the following example, the configuration for the `webdev` partition is read:

```shell-session
consul partition read -format json -meta webdev

{
   "Name": "webdev",
   "CreateIndex": 940,
   "ModifyIndex": 1458
}
```

### `list`

The `list` subcommand prints existing admin partitions to the console.

```shell-session
consul partition list <OPTIONS>
```

The admin partition is created according to the values specified in the options. You can specify the following options:

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `-format` | Specifies how to format the output of the operation in the console. | none | Optional |
| `-show-meta` | Prints the description and raft indices to the console in the response. <br/> This option does not take a value. Include the option when issuing the command to enable. | Disabled | Optional |

The following example lists the admin partitions and their meta data in JSON format:

```shell-session
consul partition list -format  json -show-meta

[
   {
      "Name": "default",
      "Description": "Builtin Default Partition",
      "CreateIndex": 4,
      "ModifyIndex": 4
   },
   {
      "Name": "webdev",
      "CreateIndex": 940,
      "ModifyIndex": 1458
   },
   {
      "Name": "webdev-bu",
      "Description": "backup webdev partition",
      "CreateIndex": 1462,
      "ModifyIndex": 1462
   }
]
```

### `delete`

The `delete` subcommand sends a request to the server to remove the specified partition.

```shell-session
consul partition delete <PARTITION_NAME>
```
In the following example, the `webdev-bu` partition is deleted:

```shell-session
consul partition delete webdev
```

## Admin Partition Definition

Admin partitions are managed exclusively through the HTTP API and the Consul CLI. The HTTP API accepts only JSON formatted definitions while the CLI will parse either JSON or HCL.

The following parameters are supported in admin partition definition files:

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `Name` | String value that specifies the name of partition you are creating or writing. <br/> The value must be valid DNS hostname value. | none | Required |
| `Description` | String value that specifies a description for the partition you are creating or writing. <br/> The value should provide human-readable information to help other users understand the purpose of the partition. | none | Optional |

### Example Definition File

The following example shows an admin partition definition file that could be used with the [`write`](#write) command to create a partition:

```hcl
Name = "dev-partition"
Description = "Partition for dev team"
```

## HTTP API Options

You can include the following options to interact with the HTTP API when using the `partition` command.

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
| ---    | ---         | ---     | ---      |
| `-ca-file` | Specifies the path to a certificate authority (CA) file when TLS is enabled.<br/> You can also specify `CONSUL_CACERT` as the value if the environment variable is configured. | none | Required if TLS is enabled |
| `-ca-path` | Specifies the path to a client certificate file when TLS is enabled. <br/> You can also specify `CONSUL_CAPATH` as the value if the environment variable is configured. | none | Required if TLS is enabled |
| `-client-cert` | Specifies the path to a client certificate file when TLS and the `verify_incoming` option are enabled. <br/> You can also specify `CONSUL_CLIENT_CERT` as the value if the environment variable is configured. | none | Required if TLS and `verify_incoming` are enabled |
| `-client-key` | Specifies the path to a client key file when TLS and the `verify_incoming` option are enabled. <br/> You can also specify `CONSUL_CLIENT_KEY` as the value if the environment variable is configured. | none | Required if TLS and `verify_incoming` are enabled |
| `-datacenter` | Specifies the name of the datacenter to query. <br/> Non-default admin partitions are only supported in the primary datacenter. | Datacenter of the queried agent | Required if the agent is in a non-primary datacenter. |
| `-http-addr` | Specifies the address and port number of the Consul HTTP agent. <br/>IP and DNS addresses are supported. The address must also include the port. <br/>You can also specify `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` if the environment variable is configured. <br/>To use an HTTPS address, set the `CONSUL_HTTP_SSL` environment variable to `true`. | `http://127.0.0.1:8500` | Optional |
| `-stale` | Boolean value that enables any Consul server (non-leader) to respond to the request. <br/>This switch can lower latency and increase throughput, but may result in stale data. This option has no effect on non-read operations. | `false` | Optional |
