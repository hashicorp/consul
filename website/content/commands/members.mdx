# Consul Members

Command: `consul members`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[GET\] /v1/agent/members](/consul/api-docs/agent#list-members)

The `members` command outputs the current list of members that a Consul
agent knows about, along with their state. The state of a node can only
be "alive", "left", or "failed".

Nodes in the "failed" state are still listed because Consul attempts to
reconnect with failed nodes for a certain amount of time in the case
that the failure is actually just a network partition.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.
