# Consul Reload

Command: `consul reload`

The `reload` command triggers a reload of configuration files for the agent.

The `SIGHUP` signal is usually used to trigger a reload of configurations,
but in some cases it may be more convenient to trigger the CLI instead.

This command operates the same as the signal, meaning that it will trigger
a reload, but does not wait for the reload to complete. Any errors with the
reload will be present in the agent logs and not in the output of this command.

**NOTE**

Not all configuration options are reloadable. See the
[Reloadable Configuration](/docs/agent/options#reloadable-configuration)
section on the agent options page for details on which options are supported.
