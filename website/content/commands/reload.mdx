# Consul Reload

Command: `consul reload`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[PUT\] /v1/agent/reload](/api-docs/agent#reload-agent)

The `reload` command triggers a reload of configuration files for the agent.

The `SIGHUP` signal is usually used to trigger a reload of configurations,
but in some cases it may be more convenient to trigger the CLI instead.

This command operates the same as the signal, meaning that it will trigger
a reload, but does not wait for the reload to complete. Any errors with the
reload will be present in the agent logs and not in the output of this command.

**NOTE**

Not all configuration options are reloadable. See the
[Reloadable Configuration](/docs/agent/config#reloadable-configuration)
section on the agent options page for details on which options are supported.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.
