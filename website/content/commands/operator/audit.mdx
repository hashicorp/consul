# Consul Operator Audit

Command: `consul operator audit`

<EnterpriseAlert />

Consul Enterprise audit logging captures a list of authenticated events that 
Consul processes through its HTTP API. The `operator audit` command is used to 
interact with Consul's audit logging subsystem.

See the [audit logging documentation](/consul/docs/monitor/log/audit) for more details.

```text
Usage: consul operator audit <subcommand> [options]
  The Audit operator command is used to interact with Consul's Audit logging subsystem. The
  command can be used to calculate the audit log hash of a given string.

Subcommands:
    hash    Computes the audit hash of a string
```

If ACLs are enabled, the client will need to supply an ACL Token with `operator`
read or write privileges to use these commands.

## hash

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[POST\] /v1/operator/audit-hash](/consul/api-docs/operator/audit)

Computes the audit hash of a string. Can optionally compare the computed hash to a specified hash.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.

| ACL Required     |
| ---------------- |
| `operator:read`  |

Usage: `consul operator audit hash -input INPUT [options]`

#### API Options

@include 'legacy/http_api_options_client.mdx'

@include 'legacy/http_api_options_server.mdx'

#### Command Options

- `-hash-to-match=<string>` - Optional. If specified, the command outputs whether this value matches the computed hash of the 'input' value. Should be in the format: `hmac_sha256:xxxx`

- `-input=<string>` - Specifies the input string to hash. This flag is required.

### Examples

Display audit hash of provided value:

```shell-session
$ consul operator audit hash -input="my-value"
```

Compare audit hash of provided value:

```
$ consul operator audit hash -input="my-value" -hash-to-match="hmac_sha256:37ed9ed..."
```
