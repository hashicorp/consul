# Consul Operator Utilization

Command: `consul operator utilization`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[GET\] /v1/operator/utilization](/consul/api-docs/operator/utilization)

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `operator utilization` command generates a license utilization bundle that you may share with HashiCorp. This command writes the bundle to a JSON file and optionally sends the bundle automatically to HashiCorp during generation. 

Air-gapped environments or environments that are unable to satisfy [automatic reporting requirements](/consul/docs/enterprise/license/reporting#requirements) can use the `operator utilization` command to generate a license utilization report that you can send to HashiCorp directly or submit using a different process.

Refer to [Automated license utilization reporting](/consul/docs/enterprise/license/reporting) for more details.

The following tableshows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Commands do not support configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) or [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), but the corresponding HTTP endpoint may support that configuration.
