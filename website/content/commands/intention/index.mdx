# Consul Intention

Command: `consul intention`

The `intention` command is used to interact with service mesh
[intentions](/consul/docs/connect/intentions). It exposes commands for
creating, updating, reading, deleting, checking, and managing intentions.
This command is available in Consul 1.2 and later.

Use the 
[`service-intentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) configuration entry or the [HTTP
API](/consul/api-docs/connect/intentions) to manage intentions.

~> **Deprecated** - This command is deprecated in Consul 1.9.0 in favor of
using the [config entry CLI command](/consul/commands/config/write). To create an
intention, create or modify a
[`service-intentions`](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entry for the destination.

## Usage

Usage: `consul intention <subcommand>`

For more information, examples, and usage about a subcommand, click on the name
of the subcommand in the sidebar.

## Basic Examples

Create an intention to allow "web" to talk to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention create web db
```

Create an intention to deny "db" from initiating connections to _any_ service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention create -deny db '*'
Created: db => * (deny)
```

Test whether a "web" is allowed to connect to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention check web db
```

List all intentions:

```shell-session
$ consul intention list
```

Find all intentions for communicating to the "db" service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention match db
```

## Source and Destination Naming

Intention commands commonly take positional arguments referred to as `SRC` and
`DST` in the command documentation. These can take several forms:

| Format                              | Meaning                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<service>`                         | the named service in the current namespace                                                    |
| `*`                                 | any service in the current namespace                                                          |
| `<namespace>/<service>`             | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> the named service in a specific namespace in the default partition |
| `<namespace>/*`                     | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in the specified namespace in the default partition    |
| `*/*`                               | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in any namespace in the default partition              |
| `<partition>/<namespace>/<service>` | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> the named service in a specific namespace                          |
| `<partition>/<namespace>/*`         | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in the specified namespace in a specific partition     |
| `<partition>/*/*`                   | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in any namespace in the  a specific  partition         |
