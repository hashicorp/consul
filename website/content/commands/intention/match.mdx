# Consul Intention Match

Command: `consul intention match`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[GET\] /v1/connect/intentions/match](/consul/api-docs/connect/intentions#list-matching-intentions)

The `intention match` command shows the list of intentions that match
a given source or destination. The list of intentions is listed in evaluation
order: the first intention that matches a request would be evaluated.

The [check](/consul/commands/intention/check) command can be used to
check whether an L4 connection would be authorized between any two services.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching)
