# Consul Intention Delete

Command: `consul intention delete`

The `intention delete` command deletes a matching intention.

-> **Deprecated** - The one argument form of this command is deprecated in
Consul 1.9.0. Intentions no longer need IDs when represented as
[`service-intentions`](/docs/connect/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entries.

## Usage

Usage:

- `consul intention delete [options] SRC DST`
- `consul intention delete [options] ID`

`SRC` and `DST` can both take [several forms](/commands/intention#source-and-destination-naming).

#### API Options
