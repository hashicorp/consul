# Consul Intention Check

Command: `consul intention check`

Corresponding HTTP API Endpoint: [\[GET\] /v1/connect/intentions/check](/api-docs/connect/intentions#check-intention-result)

The `intention check` command checks whether a connection attempt between
two services would be authorized given the current set of intentions and
Consul configuration.

This command requires less ACL permissions than other intention-related
tasks because no information about the intention is revealed. Therefore,
callers only need to have `service:read` access for the destination. Richer
commands like [match](/commands/intention/match) require full
intention read permissions and don't evaluate the result.

-> **Note:** This command will always treat intentions with `Permissions`
defined as _deny_ intentions during evaluation, as this endpoint is only suited
for networking layer 4 (e.g. TCP) integration.

The table below shows this command's [required ACLs](/api-docs/api-structure#authentication). Configuration of
[blocking queries](/api-docs/features/blocking) and [agent caching](/api-docs/features/caching)
are not supported from commands, but may be from the corresponding HTTP endpoint.

| ACL Required                  |

<p>
  <sup>1</sup> Intention ACL rules are specified as part of a{' '}
  <code>service</code> rule. See{' '}
