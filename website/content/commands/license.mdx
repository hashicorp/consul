# Consul License

Command: `consul license`

<EnterpriseAlert />

The `license` command provides a list of all datacenters that use the Consul Enterprise license applied to the current datacenter.

~> **Warning**: Consul 1.10.0 removed the ability to set and reset the license using the CLI.
See the [licensing documentation](/docs/enterprise/license/overview) for more information about
Consul Enterprise license management.

If ACLs are enabled then a token with operator privileges may be required in
order to use this command. Requests are forwarded internally to the leader
if required, so this can be run from any Consul node in a cluster. See the
[ACL Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-setup-production) for more information.

Usage: consul license <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command has subcommands for managing the Consul Enterprise license
  Here are some simple examples, and more detailed examples are
  available in the subcommands or the documentation.

  Install a new license from a file:

      $ consul license put @consul.license

  Install a new license from stdin:

      $ consul license put -

  Install a new license from a string:

      $ consul license put "<license blob>"

  Retrieve the current license:

      $ consul license get

  Inspect a license:

      $ consul license inspect "<path to license file>"

  Reset the current license:

      $ consul license reset

  For more examples, ask for subcommand help or view the documentation.

Subcommands:
    get        Get the active license
    inspect    Inspect a signed license
    put        Puts a new license in the datacenter
    reset      Resets the license in the datacenter

```

## inspect

This command inspects and validates a license. Just like a Consul agent it
can load the license from a file on disk or from the `CONSUL_LICENSE` and
`CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH` environment variables.

Usage: `consul license inspect [<options>] [<license file>]`

Inspect a license contained in a file:

```
$ consul license inspect consul.hclic
```

Inspect a license loaded from the environment:

```
$ consul license inspect
```

This will look at the CONSUL_LICENSE environment variable first
and if not present then we will look for the file specified
by the CONSUL_LICENSE_PATH environment variable.

The output looks like this:

```
