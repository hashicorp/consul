Consul DNS is the primary interface for querying records when Consul service mesh is disabled and your network runs in a non-Kubernetes environment. Consul DNS lets you look up services and nodes registered with Consul without making HTTP API requests to Consul. 

Refer to the [Consul DNS overview](/consul/docs/services/discovery/dns-overview) for additional information.
