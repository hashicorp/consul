Sameness groups are a user-defined set of admin partitions with identical configurations, including namespaces and configuration entries. By establishing cluster peering connections and exporting services between these partitions when creating a sameness group, operators can manage groups of services across regions, runtimes, and cloud environments, and implement automated service failover strategies.

Samenss groups require a [Consul Enterprise license](/consul/docs/enterprise/license). Refer to [create sameness groups](/consul/docs/segment/sameness-group) for more information.
