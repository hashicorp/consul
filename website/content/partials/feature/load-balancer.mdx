A load balancer accepts incoming traffic requests and routes them to service instances in a distributed network so that resource consumption is spread between available instances and individual nodes are not overworked. Consul functions as a load balancer by directing traffic to healthy service instances using information registered to the catalog and Consul DNS. Consul can also integrate with external load balancers such as NGINX and HAProxy.

Load balancing is a core component of Consul's service discovery functionality. For more information, refer to [load balancing overview](/consul/docs/discover/load-balancer).
