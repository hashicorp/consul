Admin partitions define one or more administrative boundaries for a Consul deployment. They exist one level above namespaces in Consul's identity hierarchy. Server clusters that manage multiple admin partitions require a [Consul Enterprise license](/consul/docs/enterprise/license). 

Admin partitions enable [cluster peering connections](/consul/docs/link/cluster-peering) and [sameness groups](/consul/docs/segment/sameness-group) between Consul datacenters deployed in different regions or cloud environments. Refer to the [admin partition documentation](/consul/docs/segment/admin-partition) for more information.
