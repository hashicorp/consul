Prepared queries are configurations that enable you to register a complex service query and perform dynamic lookups on services using Consul DNS. Prepared queries enable advanced lookup scenarios such filtering by multiple tags and returning services that match a prefix. You can also use prepared queries to implement service failover scenarios between datacenters.

For more information, refer to [Perform dynamic service lookups with prepared queries](/consul/docs/discover/prepared-query).
