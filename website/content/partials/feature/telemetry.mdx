Consul agents, dataplanes, gateways, and sidecar proxies emit metrics that you can access and visualize using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. Consul's UI can display visualizations of service mesh topologies and L7 metrics when they are enabled and configured in Consul. [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/central) enables additional visualizations of cluster insights using dashboards and configurations managed by HashiCorp.

Refer to [service mesh telemetry on virtual machines (VMs)](/consul/docs/observe/telemetry/vms) or [service mesh telemetry on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/observe/telemetry/k8s) for more information.
