Mesh gateways route service mesh traffic between Consul datacenters that reside in different cloud or runtime environments where general interconnectivity between all services in all datacenters is not feasible. In hybrid or multi-cloud production environments, mesh gateways secure communication between datacenters deployed to different cloud regions or platforms.

After you register a mesh gateway with Consul, you can configure a service's sidecar proxy to enable the mesh gateway as a service upstream. Refer to the [Mesh gateway documentation](/consul/docs/link/mesh-gateway) for more information.
