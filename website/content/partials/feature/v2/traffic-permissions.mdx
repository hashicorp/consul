TrafficPermissions is a v2 resource that defines rules for allowing and denying traffic between services within the service mesh. When the v2 catalog is enabled, this resource replaces the service intentions configuration entry. Traffic permissions authorize service-to-service communication for both L4 and L7 applications according to a workload's identity instead of a service name. 

For more information, refer to [v2 Catalog API](/consul/docs/architecture/catalog/v2).
