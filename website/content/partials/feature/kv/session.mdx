Consul provides a session mechanism you can use to build distributed locks. When the services in an application's service mesh operate across multiple nodes, distributed locks can restrict traffic between nodes to prevent resource exhaustion and application failure. Sessions can be configured to use data from Consul's KV store.

For more information, refer to [Sessions overview](/consul/docs/dynamic-config/sessions).
