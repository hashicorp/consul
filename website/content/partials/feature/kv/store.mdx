Consul includes a built-in key/value store that stores indexed objects on Consul servers and makes them accessible by any Consul agent. Advanced deployment strategies leverage Consul's KV store to watch for changes, create distributed semaphors, and dynamically generate configuration files for automated deployments. Consul's KV store is enabled by default. The Consul KV API, CLI, and UI are now considered feature complete and no new feature development is planned for future releases.
