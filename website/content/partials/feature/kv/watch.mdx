Watches can monitor a datacenter's key/value (KV) store, services, nodes, health checks, and events for updates. You can configure a view of data to watch in an agent configuration file so that when the data changes, Consul invokes a handler that can call an HTTP endpoint or run an executable.

For more information, refer to [Watches overview](/consul/docs/dynamic-config/watch).
