### Auth methods

Auth methods are components that perform authentication against a trusted external party to authorize the creation of ACL tokens for use within the local datacenter. Refer to the [auth methods documentation](/consul/docs/secure/acl/auth-method) for details about how to leverage auth methods in your network.
