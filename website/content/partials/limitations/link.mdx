If you experience errors when linking segments of your network, refer to the following list of technical constraints.

- Consul does not support deployments that use WAN federation and cluster peering simultaneously.
- The Consul UI does not support the creation of cluster peering connections, WAN-federated datacenters, federated network areas, or mesh gateways. A dedicated user interface to view, create, and manage cluster peering connections is available through [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/monitor/consul-central/network-views#cluster-peering).
