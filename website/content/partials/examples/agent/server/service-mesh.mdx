### Server node in a service mesh

The following example configuration is for a server agent named "`consul-server`". The server is [bootstrapped](/consul/commands/agent#_bootstrap) and the Consul GUI is enabled.
The reason this server agent is configured for a service mesh is that the `connect` configuration is enabled. The connect subsystem provides Consul's service mesh capabilities, including service-to-service connection authorization and encryption using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS). Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections without being aware of Consul service mesh at all. Refer to [Consul Service Mesh](/consul/docs/connect) for details.
