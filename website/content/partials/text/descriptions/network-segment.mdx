Network segments enable Consul deployments for organizations with network rules or firewalls that prevent full connectivity between all agents in a datacenter's gossip pool. Establishing communication boundaries with Consul network segments limits Consul's connectivity requirements to an individual segment. 

Network segments are defined in agent configuration files and require a [Consul Enterprise license](/consul/docs/enterprise/license). Refer to the [network segments documentation](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/network-segment) for more information.
