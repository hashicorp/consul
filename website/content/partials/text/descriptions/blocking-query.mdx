Many Consul API endpoints support blocking queries. In a blocking query, Consul waits until an update occurs and then returns a response to the HTTP request. Because connections can remain open without updates occuring, configure timeouts to control blocking query behavior. Blocking queries are an important part of some of Consul's advanced networking automations. To learn more, refer to [Blocking Queries in the Consul API documentation](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking).
