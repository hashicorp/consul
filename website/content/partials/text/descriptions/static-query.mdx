To lookup details about registered services and specific service instances, perform a static query using Consul DNS to return A and SRV records for your deployment. Consul DNS enables you to return results from across your Consul deployment, including the number of healthy instances and network addresses of nodes that match service names or custom tags.

Consul Enterprise enables static lookups for Enterprise features such as virtual services and sameness groups. Refer to [Perform static DNS queries](/consul/docs/discover/service/static) for more information.
