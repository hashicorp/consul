Admin partitions define one or more administrative boundaries for a Consul deployment. They exist one level above namespaces in Consul's identity hierarchy. Server clusters that manage multiple admin partitions require a [Consul Enterprise license](/consul/docs/enterprise/license). 

Admin partitions enable [cluster peering connections](/consul/docs/east-west/cluster-peering) and [sameness groups](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/sameness-group/vm) between Consul datacenters deployed in different regions or cloud environments. Refer to the [admin partition documentation](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/admin-partition) for more information.
