_Service discovery_ helps you discover, track, and monitor the health of services within a network. It uses a service's identity instead of traditional access information, such as IP address and port, to dynamically map services and track any changes within a service catalog. Service consumers can then use DNS to dynamically retrieve other service's access information from the service catalog.
