Namespaces isolate data for different users or teams. They exist one level below admin partitions in Consul's identity hierarchy. Server clusters register services to multiple namespaces require a [Consul Enterprise license](/consul/docs/enterprise/license). 

Namespaces can help reduce operational challenges by removing restrictions around uniqueness of resource names across distinct teams. You can secure namespace resources with Consul's Access Control List (ACL) system. Refer to the [namespace documentation](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/namespace) for more information.
