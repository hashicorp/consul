If you experience errors when deploying or upgrading Consul in a Kubernetes namespace different than the default `consul`, refer to the following list of technical constraints:

- Consul cannot automatically detect its target Kubernetes namespace, so you need to explicitly list that Kubernetes namespace with `-namespace` in the Helm or Consul K8s CLI parameters.
- Consul needs its target Kubernetes namespace added to the `connectInjector.k8sAllowNamspaces` Helm chart value. For more information, refer to this specific setting in the [Consul Helm chart reference](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-k8sallownamespaces).
