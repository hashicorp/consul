# Consul Intention

Command: `consul intention`

The `intention` command is used to interact with Connect
[intentions](/docs/connect/intentions). It exposes commands for
creating, updating, reading, deleting, checking, and managing intentions.
This command is available in Consul 1.2 and later.

Intentions are managed primarily via
[`service-intentions`](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-intentions) config
entries after Consul 1.9. Intentions may also be managed via the [HTTP
API](/api/connect/intentions).

## Usage

Usage: `consul intention <subcommand>`

For the exact documentation for your Consul version, run `consul intention -h` to view
the complete list of subcommands.

```text
Usage: consul intention <subcommand> [options] [args]

  ...

Subcommands:
    check     Check whether a connection between two services is allowed.
    create    Create intentions for service connections.
    delete    Delete an intention.
    get       Show information about an intention.
    match     Show intentions that match a source or destination.
```

of the subcommand in the sidebar.

## Basic Examples

Create an intention to allow "web" to talk to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention create web db
```

Create an intention to deny "db" from initiating connections to _any_ service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention create -deny db '*'
Created: db => * (deny)
```

Test whether a "web" is allowed to connect to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention check web db
```

Find all intentions for communicating to the "db" service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention match db
```

## Source and Destination Naming

Intention commands commonly take positional arguments referred to as `SRC` and
`DST` in the command documentation. These can take several forms:

| Format                  | Meaning                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<service>`             | the named service in the current namespace                           |
| `*`                     | any service in the current namespace                                 |
| `<namespace>/<service>` | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> the named service in a specific namespace |
| `<namespace>/*`         | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in the specified namespace    |
| `*/*`                   | <EnterpriseAlert inline /> any service in any namespace              |
