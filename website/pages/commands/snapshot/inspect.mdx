# Consul Snapshot Inspect

Command: `consul snapshot inspect`

The `snapshot inspect` command is used to inspect an atomic, point-in-time
snapshot of the state of the Consul servers which includes key/value entries,
service catalog, prepared queries, sessions, and ACLs. The snapshot is read
from the given file.

The following fields are displayed when inspecting a snapshot:

- `ID` - A unique ID for the snapshot, only used for differentiation purposes.

- `Size` - The size of the snapshot, in bytes.

- `Index` - The Raft index of the latest log entry in the snapshot.

- `Term` - The Raft term of the latest log entry in the snapshot.

- `Version` - The snapshot format version. This only refers to the structure of
  the snapshot, not the data contained within.
