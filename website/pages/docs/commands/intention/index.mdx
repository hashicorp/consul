## Basic Examples

Create an intention to allow "web" to talk to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention create web db
```

Create an intention to deny "db" from initiating connections to _any_ service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention create -deny db '*'
Created: db => * (deny)
```

Test whether a "web" is allowed to connect to "db":

```shell-session
$ consul intention check web db
```

Find all intentions for communicating to the "db" service:

```shell-session
$ consul intention match db
```
