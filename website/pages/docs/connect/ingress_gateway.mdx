# Ingress Gateways

-> **1.8.0+:**  This feature is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

Ingress gateways enable services from outside the Consul service mesh to send
traffic to services inside the mesh. These gateways act as an entrypoint for
outside traffic and allow users to define what services should be exposed and
on what port. They allow for defining a set of
[listeners](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway#listeners) that each map
to a set of backing
[services](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway#services).

Depending on the
[protocol](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway#protocol) defined for a
listener, multiple services can be specified for a single listener. In this
case, the ingress gateway relies on host/authority headers to decide the
service that should receive the traffic.

To enable easier service discovery, a new Consul [DNS
subdomain](/docs/agent/dns#ingress-service-lookups) is provided, on
`<service>.ingress.<domain>`.

## Prerequisites

Ingress gateways also require that your Consul datacenters are configured correctly:

- You'll need to use Consul version 1.8.0.
- Consul [Connect](/docs/agent/options#connect) must be enabled in the datacenter.
- [gRPC](/docs/agent/options#grpc_port) must be enabled.

Currently, Envoy is the only proxy with ingress gateway capabilities in Consul.

## Running and Using an Ingress Gateway

The steps that need to occur for an Ingress Gateway to proxy traffic to services in the Consul mesh are as follows:

1. Run an envoy proxy using the [envoy subcommand](/docs/commands/connect/envoy), specifying the `ingress` gateway type.
2. Create an `ingress-gateway` [configuration entry](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway) that defines a set of listeners that expose the desired backing services.
3. Ensure that [intentions](/docs/connect/intentions) are setup between the ingress gateway service and the backing services.
4. **Optionally** use the `<service>.ingress.<domain>` [DNS subdomain](/docs/agent/dns#ingress-service-lookups) to send requests through the ingress gateway
