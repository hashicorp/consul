# UI Visualization

Since Consul 1.9.0, Consul's built in UI includes a topology visualization to
show a service's immediate connectivity at a glance. It is not intended as a
replacement for dedication monitoring solutions, but rather as a quick overview
of the state of a service and it's connections within the Service Mesh.

The topology visualization requires services to be using [Consul
Connect](/docs/connect) via [side-car proxies](/docs/connect/proxies).

The visualization may optionally be configured to include a link to an external
per-service dashboard. This is designed to provide convenient deep links to your
existing monitoring or Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solution for
each service. More information can be found in [Configuring Dashboard
URLs](#configuring-dashboard-urls).

It is possible to configure the UI to fetch basic metrics from your metrics
provider storage to augment the visualization as displayed below.

Consul has built-in support for overlaying metrics from a
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) backend. Alternative metrics providers may
be supported using a new and experimental Javascript API. See [Custom Metrics
Providers](#custom-metrics-providers).


## Configuring the UI To Display Metrics

To configure Consul's UI to be able to fetch metrics there are several
configuration variables needed. These need to be set on each Consul Agent that
is responsible for serving the UI. If there are multiple clients with the UI
enabled in a Datacenter for redundancy, these configurations should be added to
all of them.

We assume that the UI is already enabled which since Consul 1.9.0 is done by
setting [`ui_config.enabled`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_enabled) to `true`
in the agent's configuration file.

To use the built-in Prometheus provider,
[`ui_config.metrics_provider`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_metrics_provider)
must be set to `prometheus`.

Finally, the UI currently must query the metrics provider through a proxy
endpoint to simplify setup where Prometheus isn't already publicly available to
user's browsers directly.

To set this up, provide the URL that the _Consul agent_ can reach the Prometheus
server on in
[`ui_config.metrics_proxy.base_url`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_metrics_proxy_base_url).
For example in Kubernetes, the Prometheus helm chart by default installs a
service named `prometheus-server` so each Consul agent can reach it on
`http://prometheus-server` (using Kubernetes' DNS resolution).

A full configuration to enable Prometheus is given below.

```hcl
ui_config {
  enabled = true
  metrics_provider = "prometheus"
  metrics_proxy {
    base_url = "http://prometheus-server"
  }
}
```

## Configuring Dashboard URLs

Since Consul's visualization is intended as an overview of your mesh and not a
comprehensive monitoring tool, you can configure a service dashboard URL
template which allows users to click directly through to the relevant
service-specific dashboard in an external tool like Grafana or a hosted
provider.

To configure this, you must provide a URL template in the [agent configuration
file](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_dashboard_url_templates) for all agents that
have the UI enabled. The template is essentially the URL to the external
dashboard, but can have placeholder values which will be replaced with the
service name, namespace and datacenter where appropriate to allow deep-linking
to the relevant information.

An example with Grafana is shown below.

```hcl
ui_config {
  enabled = true
  dashboard_url_templates {
    service = "https://grafana.example.com/d/lDlaj-NGz/ ⏎
      service-overview?orgId=1&var-service={{Service.Name}}& ⏎
      var-namespace={{Service.Namespace}}&var-dc={{Datacenter}}"
  }
}
```

### Metrics Proxy

In many cases the metrics backend may not be exposed outside of the datacenter
to user's browser or may be on a different domain and so subject to CORS
restrictions. To make it simpler to serve the metrics to the UI in these cases,
the Consul agent can proxy requests for metrics from the UI to the backend.

**This is intended to enable simple setup in test and demo environments. Careful
consideration should be given towards using this in production.**

The simplest configuration is described in [Configuring the UI for
metrics](#configuring-the-ui-for-metrics).

#### Metrics Proxy Security

~> **Security Note**: Exposing a backend metrics service to potentially
 un-authenticated network traffic via the proxy should be _carefully_ considered
 in production.

The proxy endpoint is an internal one intended only for UI use however by
enabling it anyone with network access to the agent's API port is potentially
able to access metrics from the backend.

**If ACLs are not enabled, full access to metrics will be exposed to
un-authenticated workloads on the network**.

With ACLs enabled, the proxy endpoint requires a valid token with read access to
all nodes and services (across all namespaces in Enterprise). It's typical for
most authenticated users to have this level of access in Consul as it's required
for viewing the catalog or discovering services. For example if you use a
[Single Sign-On
integration](http://localhost:3000/docs/security/acl/auth-methods/oidc) (Consul
Enterprise) for the UI the users will automatically be issued an ACL token that
will be allowed access to the metrics through the proxy.

Even with ACLs enabled, the proxy endpoint doesn't deeply understand the query
language of the backend so there is no way it can enforce least-privilege access
to only specific service-related metrics.

_If you are not comfortable with all users of Consul having full access to the
metrics backend, you should not use the proxy and find an alternative like using
a custom provider that can query the metrics backend directly_.

##### Path Allowlist

To limit exposure of the metrics backend, paths must be explicitly added to an
allowlist to avoid exposing unintended parts of the API. For example with
Prometheus, both the `/api/v1/query_range` and `/api/v1/query` endpoints are
needed to load time-series and individual stats. If the proxy had the `base_url`
set to `http://prometheus-server` then the proxy would also expose read access
to several other endpoints such as `/api/v1/status/config` which includes all
Prometheus configuration which might include sensitive information.

The default value for `metrics_proxy.path_allowlist` is `["/api/v1/query_range",
"/api/v1/query"]` so that if you are using the built in provider, this is
already limited to the essential endpoints.

If you use a custom provider that uses the metrics proxy, you'll need to
explicitly set the allowlist based on the endpoints the provider needs to
access.

#### Adding Headers

It is also possible to configure the proxy to add one or more headers to
requests as they pass through. This is useful when the metrics backend requires
authentication. For example if your metrics are shipped to a hosted provider,
you could provision an API token specifically for the Consul UI and configure
the proxy to add it as in the example below. This keeps the API token only
visible to Consul operators in the configuration file while UI users can query
the metrics they need without separately obtaining a token for that provider or
having a token exposed to them that they might be able to use elsewhere.

```hcl
ui_config {
  enabled = true
  metrics_provider = "example-apm"
  metrics_proxy {
    base_url = "http://example-apm/api/v1/metrics"
    add_headers = [
      {
        name = "Authorization"
        value = "Bearer <token>"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Custom Metrics Providers

Consul 1.9.0 includes a built-in provider for fetching metrics from
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). To enable others to use the feature along
with other existing metrics stores and hosted services, we created a "metrics
provider" interface in Javascript. A custom provider may be written and the
javascript file served by the Consul agent.

~> **Note**: this interface is _experimental_ and may change in breaking ways or
 be removed entirely as we discover the needs of the community. Please provide
 feedback on Github or [Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/) on how you'd
 like to use this.

The template for a complete provider Javascript file is given below.

```Javascript
(function () {
  var provider = {
    /**
     * init is called when the provider is first loaded.
     *
     * options.providerOptions contains any operator configured parameters
     * specified in the `metrics_provider_options_json` field of the Consul
     * agent configuration file.
     *
     * Consul will provide a boolean field options.metrics_proxy_enabled to
     * indicate whether the agent has a metrics proxy configured.
     *
     * The provider should throw an Exception if the options are not valid, for
     * example because it requires a metrics proxy and one is not configured.

  // Register the provider with Consul for use. This example would be usable by

}());
```

Additionally, the built in [Prometheus
provider code](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/ui/packages/consul-ui/vendor/metrics-providers/prometheus.js)
can be used as a reference.

### Configuring the Agent With a Custom Metrics Provider.

In the example below, we configure the Consul agent to use a metrics provider
named `example-provider`, which is defined in
`/usr/local/bin/example-metrics-provider.js`. The name `example-provider` must
have been specified in the call to `consul.registerMetricsProvider` as in the
code listing in the last section.

```hcl
ui_config {
  enabled = true
  metrics_provider = "example-provider"
  metrics_provider_files = ["/usr/local/bin/example-metrics-provider.js"]
  metrics_provider_options_json = <<-EOT
    {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
  EOT
}
```

More than one javascript file may be specified in
[`metrics_provider_files`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_metrics_provider_files)
and all we be served allowing flexibility if needed to include dependencies.
Only one metrics provider can be configured and used at one time.

The
[`metrics_provider_options_json`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_metrics_provider_options_json)
field is an optional literal JSON object which is passed to the provider's
`init` method at startup time. This allows configuring arbitrary parameters for
the provider in config rather than hard coding them into the provider itself to
make providers more reusable.

The provider may fetch metrics directly from another source although in this
case the agent will probably need to serve the correct CORS headers to prevent
browsers from blocking these requests. These may be configured with
[`http_config.response_headers`](http://localhost:3000/docs/agent/options#response_headers).

Alternatively, the provider may choose to use the [built-in metrics
proxy](#metrics-proxy) to avoid cross domain issues or to inject additional
authorization headers without requiring each UI user to be separately
authenticated to the metrics backend. To do so, requests should be made to
`/v1/internal/ui/metrics-proxy/<path>`. All components in the `<path>` will be
appended to the configured
[`base_url`](/docs/agent/options#ui_config_metrics_proxy_base_url) in the
agent's metrics proxy configuration, and the request forwarded. The response
will be returned without any modification to be interpreted by the provider and
converted into the format as described in the interface above.

Provider authors should make it clear to users which paths are required so they
can correctly configure the [path allowlist](#path-allowlist) in the metrics
proxy to avoid exposing more than needed of the metrics backend.

### Custom Provider Security Model

Since the javascript file(s) are included in Consul's UI verbatim, the code in
them must be treated as fully trusted by the operator. Typically they will have
authored this or will need to carefully vet providers written by third parties.

This is equivalent to using the existing `-ui-dir` flag to serve an alternative
version of the UI - in either model the operator takes full responsibility for
the provenance of the code being served since it has the power to intercept ACL
tokens, access cookies and local storage for the Consul UI domain and possibly
more.


## Current Limitations

Currently there are some limitations to this feature.

- **No cross-datacenter support** The initial metrics provider integration is
  with Prometheus which is popular and easy to setup within one Kubernetes
  cluster. However, when using the Consul UI in a multi-datacenter deployment,
  the UI allows users to select any datacenter to view.

  This means that the Prometheus server that the Consul agent serving the UI can
  access likely only has metrics for the local datacenter and a full solution
  would need additional proxying or exposing remote Prometheus servers on the
  network in remote datacenters. Later we may support an easy way to set this up
  via Consul Connect but initially we don't attempt to fetch metrics in the UI
  if you are browsing a remote datacenter.

- **Built-in provider requires metrics proxy** Initially the built-in
  `prometheus` provider only support querying Prometheus via the [metrics
  proxy](#metrics-proxy). Later it may be possible to configure it for direct
  access to an expose Prometheus.
