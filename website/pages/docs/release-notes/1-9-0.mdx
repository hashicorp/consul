# Consul 1.9.0

## Release Highlights

## What's Changed

- Consul 1.9 is built with Go 1.15, which has dropped support for 32-bit binaries for Darwin, so we will no longer be issuing darwin_386 builds for Consul 1.9.x or newer.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#190-beta2-november-07-2020).
