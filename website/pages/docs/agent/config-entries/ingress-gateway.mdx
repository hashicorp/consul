# Ingress Gateway

-> **1.8.0+:** This config entry is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

  The `ingress-gateway` config entry kind allows for configuring Ingress gateways
  with listeners that expose a set of services outside the Consul service mesh.
  See [Ingress Gateway](/docs/connect/ingress_gateway) for more information.

## Wildcard service specification

  Ingress gateways can optionally target all services within a namespace by
  specifying a wildcard `*` as the service name. A wildcard specifier allows
  for a single listener to route traffic to all available services on the
  Consul mesh, differentiating between the services by their host/authority
  header. For a wildcard, the host/authority header is expected to match
  `<service-name>.*`.

  A wildcard specifier cannot be set on a listener of protocol `tcp`.

## Sample Config Entries

Set up a TCP listener for a single service:

```hcl
Kind = "ingress-gateway"
Name = "ingress-service"
Namespace = "default"

Listeners = [
  {
    Port = 3456
    Protocol = "tcp"
    Services = [
      {
        Name = "db"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Set up a wildcard HTTP listener to proxy traffic to all available services, and
make two services available over a custom port with user-provided hosts:

```hcl
Kind = "ingress-gateway"
Name = "ingress-service"
Namespace = "default"

Listeners = [
  {
    Port = 8080
    Protocol = "http"
    Services = [
      {
        Name = "*"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    Port = 4567
    Protocol = "http"
    Services = [
      {
        Name = "api"
        Hosts = ["foo.example.com"]
      },
      {
        Name = "web"
        Hosts = ["website.example.com"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Available Fields

- `Kind` - Must be set to `ingress-gateway`

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - Set to the name of the gateway being configured.

- `Namespace` `(string: "default")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Specifies
  the namespace the config entry will apply to. This must be the namespace
  the gateway is registered in. If omitted, the  namespace will be inherited
  from [the request](/api/config#ns) or will default to the `default` namespace.

- `Listeners` `(array<IngressListener>: <optional>)` - A list of listeners that
  the ingress gateway should setup, uniquely identified by their port number.

  - `Port` `(int: 0)` - The port that the listener should receive traffic on.

  - `Protocol` `(string: "tcp")` - The protocol associated with the listener.
    This can be any protocol supported by
    [service-defaults](/docs/agent/config-entries/service-defaults#protocol).

  - `Services` `(array<IngressService>: <optional>)` - A list of services to be
    exposed via this listener. For "tcp" listeners, only a single service is
    allowed.

    - `Name` `(string: "")` - The name of the service that should be exposed
      through this listener. This can be either a service registered in the
      catalog, or a service defined only by [other config
      entries](/docs/connect/l7-traffic-management). If the wildcard specifier,
      `*`, is provided, then ALL services will be exposed through the listener.
      This is not supported for listener's with protocol "tcp".

    - `Namespace` `(string: "")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> The namespace to resolve the service from
      instead of the current namespace. If empty the current namespace is
      assumed.

    - `Hosts` `(array<string>: <optional>)` - A list of hosts that specify what
      requests will match to this service. This cannot be used with a `tcp`
      listener, and cannot be specified alongside a `*` service name.

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by
[ACLs](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/production-acls).

Reading an `ingress-gateway` config entry requires `service:read` on the `Name`
field of the config entry.

Creating, updating, or deleting an `ingress-gateway` config entry requires
`operator:write`.
