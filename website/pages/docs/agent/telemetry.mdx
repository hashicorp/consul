# Telemetry

The Consul agent collects various runtime metrics about the performance of
different libraries and subsystems. These metrics are aggregated on a ten
second interval and are retained for one minute.

To view this data, you must send a signal to the Consul process: on Unix,
this is `USR1` while on Windows it is `BREAK`. Once Consul receives the signal,
it will dump the current telemetry information to the agent's `stderr`.

This telemetry information can be used for debugging or otherwise
getting a better view of what Consul is doing. Review the [Monitoring and
Metrics tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/monitor-datacenter-health?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs) to learn how collect and interpret Consul data.

Additionally, if the [`telemetry` configuration options](/docs/agent/options#telemetry)
are provided, the telemetry information will be streamed to a
[statsite](http://github.com/armon/statsite) or [statsd](http://github.com/etsy/statsd) server where
it can be aggregated and flushed to Graphite or any other metrics store.
For a configuration example for Telegraf, review the [Monitoring with Telegraf tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/monitor-health-telegraf?utm_source=consul.io&utm_medium=docs).

This
information can also be viewed with the [metrics endpoint](/api/agent#view-metrics) in JSON
format or using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format.

Below is sample output of a telemetry dump:

# Key Metrics

These are some metrics emitted that can help you understand the health of your cluster at a glance. For a full list of metrics emitted by Consul, see [Metrics Reference](#metrics-reference)

### Transaction timing

| Metric Name              | Description                                                                          |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.kvs.apply`       | This measures the time it takes to complete an update to the KV store.               |
| `consul.txn.apply`       | This measures the time spent applying a transaction operation.                       |
| `consul.raft.apply`      | This counts the number of Raft transactions occurring over the interval.             |
| `consul.raft.commitTime` | This measures the time it takes to commit a new entry to the Raft log on the leader. |

**Why they're important:** Taken together, these metrics indicate how long it takes to complete write operations in various parts of the Consul cluster. Generally these should all be fairly consistent and no more than a few milliseconds. Sudden changes in any of the timing values could be due to unexpected load on the Consul servers, or due to problems on the servers themselves.

**What to look for:** Deviations (in any of these metrics) of more than 50% from baseline over the previous hour.

### Leadership changes

| Metric Name                      | Description                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.raft.leader.lastContact` | Measures the time since the leader was last able to contact the follower nodes when checking its leader lease. |
| `consul.raft.state.candidate`    | This increments whenever a Consul server starts an election.                                                   |
| `consul.raft.state.leader`       | This increments whenever a Consul server becomes a leader.                                                     |

**Why they're important:** Normally, your Consul cluster should have a stable leader. If there are frequent elections or leadership changes, it would likely indicate network issues between the Consul servers, or that the Consul servers themselves are unable to keep up with the load.

**What to look for:** For a healthy cluster, you're looking for a `lastContact` lower than 200ms, `leader` > 0 and `candidate` == 0. Deviations from this might indicate flapping leadership.

### Autopilot

| Metric Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.autopilot.healthy` | This tracks the overall health of the local server cluster. If all servers are considered healthy by Autopilot, this will be set to 1. If any are unhealthy, this will be 0. |

**Why it's important:** Obviously, you want your cluster to be healthy.

**What to look for:** Alert if `healthy` is 0.

### Memory usage

| Metric Name                  | Description                                                        |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.runtime.alloc_bytes` | This measures the number of bytes allocated by the Consul process. |
| `consul.runtime.sys_bytes`   | This is the total number of bytes of memory obtained from the OS.  |

**Why they're important:** Consul keeps all of its data in memory. If Consul consumes all available memory, it will crash.

**What to look for:** If `consul.runtime.sys_bytes` exceeds 90% of total available system memory.

### Garbage collection

| Metric Name                        | Description                                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.runtime.total_gc_pause_ns` | Number of nanoseconds consumed by stop-the-world garbage collection (GC) pauses since Consul started. |

**Why it's important:** GC pause is a "stop-the-world" event, meaning that all runtime threads are blocked until GC completes. Normally these pauses last only a few nanoseconds. But if memory usage is high, the Go runtime may GC so frequently that it starts to slow down Consul.

**What to look for:** Warning if `total_gc_pause_ns` exceeds 2 seconds/minute, critical if it exceeds 5 seconds/minute.

**NOTE:** `total_gc_pause_ns` is a cumulative counter, so in order to calculate rates (such as GC/minute),
you will need to apply a function such as InfluxDB's [`non_negative_difference()`](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/query_language/functions/#non-negative-difference).

### Network activity - RPC Count

| Metric Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `consul.client.rpc`          | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server                                                                                         |
| `consul.client.rpc.exceeded` | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server gets rate limited by that agent's [`limits`](/docs/agent/options#limits) configuration. |
| `consul.client.rpc.failed`   | Increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server and fails.                                                                              |

**Why they're important:** These measurements indicate the current load created from a Consul agent, including when the load becomes high enough to be rate limited. A high RPC count, especially from `consul.client.rpcexceeded` meaning that the requests are being rate-limited, could imply a misconfigured Consul agent.

**What to look for:**
Sudden large changes to the `consul.client.rpc` metrics (greater than 50% deviation from baseline).
`consul.client.rpc.exceeded` or `consul.client.rpc.failed` count > 0, as it implies that an agent is being rate-limited or fails to make an RPC request to a Consul server

When telemetry is being streamed to an external metrics store, the interval is defined to
be that store's flush interval. Otherwise, the interval can be assumed to be 10 seconds
when retrieving metrics from the built-in store using the above described signals.

| `consul.acl.blocked..registration`                    | This increments whenever a registration fails for an entity (check, node or service) is blocked by an ACL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | requests             | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc`                                   | This increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server. This gives a measure of how much a given agent is loading the Consul servers. Currently, this is only generated by agents in client mode, not Consul servers.                                                                                                                                                       | requests             | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.exceeded`                          | This increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server gets rate limited by that agent's [`limits`](/docs/agent/options#limits) configuration. This gives an indication that there's an abusive application making too many requests on the agent, or that the rate limit needs to be increased. Currently, this only applies to agents in client mode, not Consul servers. | rejected requests    | counter |
| `consul.client.rpc.failed`                            | This increments whenever a Consul agent in client mode makes an RPC request to a Consul server and fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | requests             | counter |

| `consul.memberlist.degraded.probe`    | This metric counts the number of times the agent has performed failure detection on another agent at a slower probe rate. The agent uses its own health metric as an indicator to perform this action. (If its health score is low, means that the node is healthy, and vice versa.)                                                                                                                                                           | probes / interval                       | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.degraded.timeout`  | This metric counts the number of times an agent was marked as a dead node, whilst not getting enough confirmations from a randomly selected list of agent nodes in an agent's membership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | occurrence / interval                   | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.msg.dead`          | This metric counts the number of times an agent has marked another agent to be a dead node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | messages / interval                     | counter |
| `consul.memberlist.health.score`      | This metric describes a node's perception of its own health based on how well it is meeting the soft real-time requirements of the protocol. This metric ranges from 0 to 8, where 0 indicates "totally healthy". This health score is used to scale the time between outgoing probes, and higher scores translate into longer probing intervals. For more details see section IV of the Lifeguard paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00788.pdf | score                                   | gauge   |
| `consul.memberlist.msg.suspect`       | This increments when an agent suspects another as failed when executing random probes as part of the gossip protocol. These can be an indicator of overloaded agents, network problems, or configuration errors where agents can not connect to each other on the [required ports](/docs/agent/options#ports).                                                                                                                                 | suspect messages received / interval    | counter |

## Connect Built-in Proxy Metrics

Consul Connect's built-in proxy is by default configured to log metrics to the
same sink as the agent that starts it.

When running in this mode it emits some basic metrics. These will be expanded
upon in the future.

All metrics are prefixed with `consul.proxy.<proxied-service-id>` to distinguish
between multiple proxies on a given host. The table below use `web` as an
example service name for brevity.

### Labels

Most labels have a `dst` label and some have a `src` label. When using metrics
sinks and timeseries stores that support labels or tags, these allow aggregating
the connections by service name.

Assuming all services are using a managed built-in proxy, you can get a complete
overview of both number of open connections and bytes sent and received between
all services by aggregating over these metrics.

For example aggregating over all `upstream` (i.e. outbound) connections which
have both `src` and `dst` labels, you can get a sum of all the bandwidth in and
out of a given service or the total number of connections between two services.

### Metrics Reference

The standard go runtime metrics are exported by `go-metrics` as with Consul
agent. The table below describes the additional metrics exported by the proxy.
