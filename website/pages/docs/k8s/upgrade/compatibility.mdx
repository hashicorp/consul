# Compatibility Matrix for Consul Kubernetes and Consul 

Consul Kubernetes (consul-k8s) is managed using Consul Helm. For every release of Consul Kubernetes, a new version of the Consul Kubernetes 
Helm chart and Consul Kubernetes binary is released through the HashiCorp Helm repository. The recommended best practice is to upgrade
the Helm chart which will ensure a compatible version of the Consul Kubernetes binary is used.

## Supported Versions

| Consul Version      | Compatible Consul Helm Versions  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1.8.x               | 0.22.0 - 0.24.1                  |
| 1.7.x               | 0.17.0 - 0.21.0                  |
| 1.6.x               | 0.10.0 - 0.16.2                  |
