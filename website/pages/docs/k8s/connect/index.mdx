# Connect Service Mesh on Kubernetes

[Connect](/docs/connect) is a feature built into to Consul that enables
automatic service-to-service authorization and connection encryption across
your Consul services. Connect can be used with Kubernetes to secure pod
communication with other pods and external Kubernetes services.

The Connect sidecar running Envoy can be automatically injected into pods in
your cluster, making configuration for Kubernetes automatic.
This functionality is provided by the
[consul-k8s project](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s) and can be
automatically installed and configured using the
[Consul Helm chart](/docs/k8s/installation/install).

## Usage

When the
[Connect injector is installed](/docs/k8s/connect#installation-and-configuration),
the Connect sidecar can be automatically added to all pods. This sidecar can both
accept and establish connections using Connect, enabling the pod to communicate
to clients and dependencies exclusively over authorized and encrypted
connections.

-> **Note:** The pod specifications in this section are valid and use
publicly available images. If you've installed the Connect injector, feel free
to run the pod specifications in this section to try Connect with Kubernetes.
Please note the documentation below this section on how to properly install
and configure the Connect injector.

### Accepting Inbound Connections

An example pod is shown below with Connect enabled to accept inbound
connections. Notice that the pod would still be fully functional without
Connect. Minimal to zero modifications are required to pod specifications to
enable Connect in Kubernetes.

This pod specification starts a server that responds to any
HTTP request with the static text "hello world".

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: static-server
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: static-server
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
spec:
  containers:
    # This name will be the service name in Consul.
    - name: static-server
      image: hashicorp/http-echo:latest
      args:
        - -text="hello world"
        - -listen=:8080
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: http
    # If ACLs are enabled, the serviceAccountName must match the Consul service name.
  serviceAccountName: static-server
```

The only change for Connect is the addition of the
`consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject` annotation. This enables injection
for this pod. The injector can also be
[configured](/docs/k8s/connect#installation-and-configuration)
to automatically inject unless explicitly disabled, but the default
installation requires opt-in using the annotation shown above.

This will start a Connect sidecar that listens on a random port registered
with Consul and proxies valid inbound connections to port 8080 in the pod.
To establish a connection to the pod using Connect, a client must use another Connect
proxy. The client Connect proxy will use Consul service discovery to find
all available upstream proxies and their public ports.

In the example above, the server is listening on `:8080`. This means
the server will still bind to the pod IP and allow external connections.
This is useful to transition to Connect by allowing both Connect and
non-Connect connections. To restrict access to only Connect-authorized clients,
any listeners should bind to localhost only (such as `127.0.0.1`).

The service name registered in Consul will be set to the name of the first
container in the Pod. This can be customized with the `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service`
annotation. If using ACLs, this name must be the same as the Pod's `ServiceAccount` name.

### Connecting to Connect-Enabled Services

The example pod specification below configures a pod that is capable
of establishing connections to our previous example "static-server" service. The
connection to this static text service happens over an authorized and encrypted
connection via Connect.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: static-client
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: static-client
  annotations:
    'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
    'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams': 'static-server:1234'
spec:
  containers:
    # This name will be the service name in Consul.
    - name: static-client
      image: tutum/curl:latest
      # Just spin & wait forever, we'll use `kubectl exec` to demo
      command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', '--']
      args: ['while true; do sleep 30; done;']
    # If ACLs are enabled, the serviceAccountName must match the Consul service name.
  serviceAccountName: static-client
```

Pods must specify upstream dependencies with the
[`consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams` annotation](/docs/k8s/connect#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-service-upstreams).
This annotation declares the names of any upstream dependencies and a
local port for the proxy to listen on. When a connection is established to that local
port, the proxy establishes a connection to the target service
(`static-server` in this example) using
mutual TLS and identifying as the source service (`static-client` in this
example).

The injector will also set environment variables `<NAME>_CONNECT_SERVICE_HOST`
and `<NAME>_CONNECT_SERVICE_PORT` in every container in the pod for every defined
upstream. This is analogous to the standard Kubernetes service environment variables, but
point instead to the correct local proxy port to establish connections via
Connect.

Any containers running in the pod that need to establish connections
to dependencies must be reconfigured to use the local upstream address either
directly or using the environment variables set by the injector (defined above).
This means pods should not use Kubernetes service DNS or environment
variables for these connections.

We can verify access to the static text server using `kubectl exec`. Notice
that we use the local address and port from the upstream annotation (1234)
for this verification.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec static-client -- curl -s http://127.0.0.1:1234/
"hello world"
```

We can control access to the server using [intentions](/docs/connect/intentions).
If you use the Consul UI or [CLI](/commands/intention/create) to
create a deny [intention](/docs/connect/intentions) between
"static-client" and "static-server", connections are immediately rejected
without updating either of the running pods. You can then remove this
intention to allow connections again.

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec static-client -- curl -s http://127.0.0.1:1234/
command terminated with exit code 52
```

### Available Annotations

Annotations can be used to configure the injection behavior.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject` - If this is "true" then injection
  is enabled. If this is "false" then injection is explicitly disabled.
  The default injector behavior requires pods to opt-in to injection by
  specifying this value as "true". This default can be changed in the
  injector's configuration if desired.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service` - For pods that accept inbound
  connections, this specifies the name of the service that is being
  served. This defaults to the name of the first container in the pod.

  If using ACLs, this must be the same name as the Pod's `ServiceAccount`.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-port` - For pods that accept inbound
  connections, this specifies the port to route inbound connections to. This
  is the port that the service is listening on. The service port defaults to
  the first exposed port on any container in the pod. If specified, the value
  can be the _name_ of a configured port, such as "http" or it can be a direct
  port value such as "8080". This is the port of the _service_, the proxy
  public listener will listen on a dynamic port.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams` - The list of upstream
  services that this pod needs to connect to via Connect along with a static
  local port to listen for those connections.

  - Services

    The name of the service is the name of the service registered with Consul. You can optionally specify datacenters with this annotation.

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

  - Consul Enterprise Namespaces

    If running Consul Enterprise 1.7+, your upstream services may be running in different
    namespaces. The upstream namespace can be specified after the service name
    as `[service-name].[namespace]`. See [Consul Enterprise Namespaces](#consul-enterprise-namespaces)
    below for more details on configuring the injector.

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name].[service-namespace]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

    -> **NOTE:** If the namespace is not specified it will default to the namespace
    of the source service.

    ~> **WARNING:** Setting a namespace when not using Consul Enterprise or using a version < 1.7
    is not supported. It will be treated as part of the service name.

  - [Prepared Query](/docs/connect/proxies#dynamic-upstreams-require-native-integration)

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams': 'prepared_query:[query name]:[port]'
    ```

  - Multiple Upstreams

    If you would like to specify multiple services or upstreams, delimit them with commas

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter],[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter]"
    ```

    ```yaml
    annotations:
      "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams":"[service-name]:[port]:[optional datacenter],prepared_query:[query name]:[port]"
    ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-protocol` - For pods that will be
  registered with Consul's [central configuration](/docs/agent/config-entries)
  feature, information about the protocol the service uses is required. Users
  can define the protocol directly using this annotation on the pod spec, or by
  defining a default value for all services using the Helm chart's
  [defaultProtocol](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-centralconfig-defaultprotocol)
  option. Specific annotations will always override the default value.

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags` - A comma separated list of tags that will
  be applied to the Consul service and its sidecar.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-tags: foo,bar,baz
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-<YOUR_KEY>` - Set Consul meta key/value
  pairs that will be applied to the Consul service and its sidecar.
  The key will be what comes after `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-`, e.g.
  `consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-foo: bar` will result in `foo: bar`.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-foo: baz
    consul.hashicorp.com/service-meta-bar: baz
  ```

- `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-` - override default resource settings for
  the sidecar proxy container.
  The defaults are set in Helm config via the [`connectInject.sidecarProxy.resources`](/docs/k8s/helm#v-connectinject-sidecarproxy-resources) key.

  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-cpu-limit` - Override the default CPU limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-cpu-request` - Override the default CPU request.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-memory-limit` - Override the default memory limit.
  - `consul.hashicorp.com/sidecar-proxy-memory-request` - Override the default memory request.

### Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.

The annotations for configuring Connect must be on the pod specification.
Since higher level resources such as Deployments wrap pod specification
templates, Connect can be used with all of these higher level constructs, too.

An example `Deployment` below shows how to enable Connect injection:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: consul-example-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: consul-example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: consul-example
      annotations:
        'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: consul-example
          image: 'nginx'
      serviceAccountName: consul-example
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: consul-example
```

~> **A common mistake** is to set the annotation on the Deployment or
other resource. Ensure that the injector annotations are specified on
the _pod specification template_ as shown above.

## Installation and Configuration

The Connect sidecar proxy is injected via a
[mutating admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks)
provided by the
[consul-k8s project](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s).
This enables the automatic pod mutation shown in the usage section above.
Installation of the mutating admission webhook is automated using the
[Helm chart](/docs/k8s/installation/install).

To install the Connect injector, enable the Connect injection feature using
[Helm values](/docs/k8s/helm#configuration-values) and
upgrade the installation using `helm upgrade` for existing installs or
`helm install` for a fresh install. The Connect injector **also requires**
[client agents](/docs/k8s/helm#v-client) are enabled on
the node with pods that are using Connect and that
[gRPC is enabled](/docs/k8s/helm#v-client-grpc).

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true

client:
  enabled: true
```

This will configure the injector to inject when the
[injection annotation](#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-inject)
is set to `true`. Other values in the Helm chart can be used to limit the namespaces
the injector runs in, enable injection by default, and more.

~> NOTE: If setting `global.bootstrapACLs: true`, it's important that your pod's `ServiceAccount`
has the **same name** as the Consul service that's being registered. If not, the init
container will log: `Error logging in: Unexpected response code: 403 (rpc error making call: rpc error making call: Permission denied)`.

### Controlling Injection Via Annotation

By default, the injector will inject only when the
[injection annotation](#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-inject)
on the pod (not the deployment) is set to `true`:

```yaml
annotations:
  'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
```

### Injection Defaults

If you wish for the injector to always inject, you can set the default to `true`
in the Helm chart:

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  default: true
```

You can then exclude specific pods via annotation:

```yaml
annotations:
  'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'false'
```

### Controlling Injection Via Namespace

You can control which Kubernetes namespaces are allowed to be injected via
the `k8sAllowNamespaces` and `k8sDenyNamespaces` keys:

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  k8sAllowNamespaces: ['*']
  k8sDenyNamespaces: []
```

In the default configuration (shown above), services from all namespaces are allowed
to be injected. Whether or not they're injected depends on the value of `connectInject.default`
and the `consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject` annotation.

If you wish to only enable injection in specific namespaces, you can list only those
namespaces in the `k8sAllowNamespaces` key. In the configuration below
only the `my-ns-1` and `my-ns-2` namespaces will be enabled for injection.
All other namespaces will be ignored, even if the connect inject [annotation](#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-inject)
is set.

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  k8sAllowNamespaces: ['my-ns-1', 'my-ns-2']
  k8sDenyNamespaces: []
```

If you wish to enable injection in every namespace _except_ specific namespaces, you can
use `*` in the allow list to allow all namespaces and then specify the namespaces to exclude in the deny list:

```yaml
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  k8sAllowNamespaces: ['*']
  k8sDenyNamespaces: ['no-inject-ns-1', 'no-inject-ns-2']
```

-> **NOTE:** The deny list takes precedence over the allow list. If a namespace
is listed in both lists, it will **not** be synced.

~> **NOTE:** The `kube-system` and `kube-public` namespaces will never be injected.

### Consul Enterprise Namespaces

Consul Enterprise 1.7+ supports Consul namespaces. When Kubernetes pods are registered
into Consul, you can control which Consul namespace they are registered into.

There are three options available:

1.  **Single Destination Namespace** – Register all Kubernetes pods, regardless of namespace,
    into the same Consul namespace.

    This can be configured with:

    ```yaml
    global:
      enableConsulNamespaces: true

    connectInject:
      enabled: true
      consulNamespaces:
        consulDestinationNamespace: 'my-consul-ns'
    ```

    -> **NOTE:** If the destination namespace does not exist we will create it.

1.  **Mirror Namespaces** - Register each Kubernetes pod into a Consul namespace with the same name as its Kubernetes namespace.
    For example, pod `foo` in Kubernetes namespace `ns-1` will be synced to the Consul namespace `ns-1`.
    If a mirrored namespace does not exist in Consul, it will be created.

    This can be configured with:

    ```yaml
    global:
      enableConsulNamespaces: true

    connectInject:
      enabled: true
      consulNamespaces:
        mirroringK8S: true
    ```

1.  **Mirror Namespaces With Prefix** - Register each Kubernetes pod into a Consul namespace with the same name as its Kubernetes
    namespace **with a prefix**.
    For example, given a prefix `k8s-`, pod `foo` in Kubernetes namespace `ns-1` will be synced to the Consul namespace `k8s-ns-1`.

    This can be configured with:

    ```yaml
    global:
      enableConsulNamespaces: true

    connectInject:
      enabled: true
      consulNamespaces:
        mirroringK8S: true
        mirroringK8SPrefix: 'k8s-'
    ```

### Consul Enterprise Namespace Upstreams

To specify the namespace of your upstream services in the upstream annotation,
use the format `[service-name].[namespace]:[port]:[optional datacenter]`:

```yaml
annotations:
  'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject': 'true'
  'consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams': '[service-name].[namespace]:[port]:[optional datacenter]'
```

See [consul.hashicorp.com/connect-service-upstreams](#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-service-upstreams) for more details.

### Verifying the Installation

To verify the installation, run the
["Accepting Inbound Connections"](/docs/k8s/connect#accepting-inbound-connections)
example from the "Usage" section above. After running this example, run
`kubectl get pod static-server -o yaml`. In the raw YAML output, you should
see injected Connect containers and an annotation
`consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject-status` set to `injected`. This
confirms that injection is working properly.

If you do not see this, then use `kubectl logs` against the injector pod
and note any errors.
