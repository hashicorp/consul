# Helm Chart Reference

## Configuration (Values)

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a sane default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Consul. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

- `global` ((#v-global)) - Holds values that affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` ((#v-global-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - The master enabled/disabled setting. If true, servers,
    clients, Consul DNS and the Consul UI will be enabled. Each component can override
    this default via its component-specific "enabled" config. If false, no components
    will be installed by default and per-component opt-in is required, such as by
    setting [`server.enabled`](#v-server-enabled) to true.

  - `name` ((#v-global-name)) (`string: null`) - Set the prefix used for all resources in the Helm chart. If not set, the prefix will be `<helm release name>-consul`.

  - `domain` ((#v-global-domain)) (`string: "consul"`) - The domain Consul will answer DNS queries for (see [-domain](/docs/agent/options#_domain)) and the domain services synced from
    Consul into Kubernetes will have, e.g. `service-name.service.consul`.

  - `image` ((#v-global-image)) (`string: "consul:<latest version>"`) - The name (and tag) of the Consul Docker image for clients and servers. This can be overridden per component. This should be pinned to a specific version tag, otherwise you may inadvertently upgrade your Consul version.

    Examples:

    ```yaml
    # Consul 1.5.0
    image: "consul:1.5.0"
    # Consul Enterprise 1.5.0
    image: "hashicorp/consul-enterprise:1.5.0-ent"
    ```

  - `imageK8S` ((#v-global-imagek8s)) (`string: "hashicorp/consul-k8s:<latest version>"`) - The name (and tag) of the [consul-k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s) Docker image that is used for functionality such the catalog sync. This can be overridden per component.

    Note: support for the catalog sync's liveness and readiness probes was added to consul-k8s 0.6.0. If using an older consul-k8s version, you may need to remove these checks to make sync work. If using mesh gateways and bootstrapACLs then must be >= 0.9.0.

  - `datacenter` ((#v-global-datacenter)) (`string: "dc1"`) - The name of the datacenter that the agents should
    register as. This can't be changed once the Consul cluster is up and running since Consul
    doesn't support an automatic way to change this value currently: [https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1858](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1858).

  - `enablePodSecurityPolicies` ((#v-global-enablepodsecuritypolicies)) (`boolean: false`) - Controls whether pod
    security policies are created for the Consul components created by this chart. See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/).

  - `gossipEncryption` ((#v-global-gossipencryption)) - Configures which Kubernetes secret to retrieve Consul's
    gossip encryption key from (see [-encrypt](/docs/agent/options#_encrypt)). If secretName or
    secretKey are not set, gossip encryption will not be enabled. The secret must
    be in the same namespace that Consul is installed into.

    The secret can be created by running:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl create secret generic consul-gossip-encryption-key --from-literal=key=$(consul keygen)
    # To reference, use:
    #   gossipEncryption:
    #     secretName: consul-gossip-encryption-key
    #     secretKey: key
    ```

    - `secretName` ((#v-global-gossipencryption-secretname)) (`string: ""`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret
      that holds the gossip encryption key. The secret must be in the same namespace that Consul is installed
      into.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-global-gossipencryption-secretkey)) (`string: ""`) - The key within the Kubernetes secret
      that holds the gossip encryption key.

  - `enableConsulNamespaces` ((#v-global-enableconsulnamespaces)) (`boolean: false`) <EnterpriseAlert inline /> -
    `enableConsulNamespaces` indicates that you are running Consul Enterprise v1.7+ with a valid Consul
    Enterprise license and would like to make use of configuration beyond registering everything into
    the `default` Consul namespace. Requires consul-k8s v0.12+. Additional configuration
    options are found in the `consulNamespaces` section of both the catalog sync
    and connect injector.

  - `bootstrapACLs` ((#v-global-bootstrapacls)) (`boolean: false`) - **[DEPRECATED]** Use `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` instead.

  - `acls` ((#v-global-acls)) - Configure ACLs.

    - `manageSystemACLs` ((#v-global-acls-managesystemacls)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will automatically manage ACL tokens and policies for all Consul and consul-k8s components.
      This requires servers to be running inside Kubernetes. Additionally requires Consul >= 1.4 and consul-k8s >= 0.14.0.

    - `bootstrapToken` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken)) - A Kubernetes secret containing the bootstrap token to use for
      creating policies and tokens for all Consul and consul-k8s components.
      If set, we will skip ACL bootstrapping of the servers and will only initialize ACLs for the Consul clients and consul-k8s system components.
      Requires consul-k8s >= 0.14.0.

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-acls-bootstraptoken-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key of the Kubernetes secret.

  - `tls` ((#v-global-tls)) - Enables TLS [encryption](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/agent-encryption) across the cluster to verify authenticity of the Consul servers and clients. Requires Consul v1.4.1+ and consul-k8s v0.16.2+

    - `enabled` ((#v-global-tls-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will enable TLS for Consul
      servers and clients and all consul-k8s components, as well as generate certificate
      authority (optional) and server and client certificates.

    - `enableAutoEncrypt` ((#v-global-tls-enableAutoEncrypt)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, turns on the auto-encrypt feature on clients and servers.
      It also switches consul-k8s components to retrieve the CA from the servers via the API. Requires Consul 1.7.1+ and consul-k8s 0.13.0

    - `serverAdditionalDNSSANs` ((#v-global-serveradditionaldnsssans)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of additional DNS names to set as Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the server certificate. This is useful when you need to access the Consul server(s) externally, for example, if you're using the UI.

    - `serverAdditionalIPSANs` ((#v-global-serveradditionalipsans)) (`array<string>: []`) - A list of additional IP addresses to set as Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the server certificate. This is useful when you need to access the Consul server(s) externally, for example, if you're using the UI.

    - `verify` ((#v-global-verify)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, `verify_outgoing`, `verify_server_hostname`,
      and `verify_incoming_rpc` will be set to `true` for Consul servers and clients.
      Set this to false to incrementally roll out TLS on an existing Consul cluster.
      Please see [Configuring TLS on an Existing Cluster](/docs/k8s/tls-on-existing-cluster)
      for more details.

    - `httpsOnly` ((#v-global-httpsonly)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, the Helm chart will configure Consul
      to disable the HTTP port on both clients and servers and to only accept HTTPS connections.

    - `caCert` ((#v-global-cacert)) - A Kubernetes secret containing the certificate of the CA to use for
      TLS communication within the Consul cluster. If you have generated the CA yourself
      with the consul CLI, you could use the following command to create the secret
      in Kubernetes:

      ```bash
      kubectl create secret generic consul-ca-cert \
              --from-file='tls.crt=./consul-agent-ca.pem'
      ```

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-cacert-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-cacert-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key of the Kubernetes secret.

    - `caKey` ((#v-global-cakey)) - A Kubernetes secret containing the private key of the CA to use for
      TLS communication within the Consul cluster. If you have generated the CA yourself
      with the consul CLI, you could use the following command to create the secret
      in Kubernetes:

      ```bash
      kubectl create secret generic consul-ca-key \
              --from-file='tls.key=./consul-agent-ca-key.pem'
      ```

      - `secretName` ((#v-global-cakey-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the Kubernetes secret.

      - `secretKey` ((#v-global-cakey-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key of the Kubernetes secret.

- `server` ((#v-server)) - Values that configure running a Consul server within Kubernetes.

  - `enabled` ((#v-server-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, the chart will install all
    the resources necessary for a Consul server cluster. If you're running Consul externally and
    want agents within Kubernetes to join that cluster, this should probably be false.

  - `image` ((#v-server-image)) (`string: global.image`) - The name of the Docker image (including any
    tag) for the containers running Consul server agents.

  - `replicas` ((#v-server-replicas)) (`integer: 3`) -The number of server agents to run. This
    determines the fault tolerance of the cluster. Please see the [deployment table](/docs/internals/consensus#deployment-table)
    for more information.

  - `bootstrapExpect` ((#v-server-bootstrapexpect)) (`integer: 3`) - For new clusters, this is the
    number of servers to wait for before performing the initial leader election and bootstrap of the cluster. This must be less than or equal to `server.replicas`. This value is only used
    when bootstrapping new clusters, it has no effect during ongoing cluster maintenance.

  - `enterpriseLicense` ((#v-server-enterpriselicense)) <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - This value refers to a
    Kubernetes secret that you have created that contains your enterprise license. It is required if you are using an enterprise binary. Defining it here applies it to your cluster once a leader
    has been elected. If you are not using an enterprise image or if you plan to
    introduce the license key via another route, then set these fields to null.

    - `secretName` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense-secretname)) (`string: null`) - The name of the
      Kubernetes secret that holds the enterprise license. The secret must be in the same namespace that Consul is installed into.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-global-enterpriselicense-secretkey)) (`string: null`) - The key within the
      Kubernetes secret that holds the enterprise license.

  - `storage` ((#v-server-storage)) (`string: 10Gi`) - This defines the disk size for configuring the
    servers' StatefulSet storage. For dynamically provisioned storage classes, this is the
    desired size. For manually defined persistent volumes, this should be set to
    the disk size of the attached volume.

  - `storageClass` ((#v-server-storageclass)) (`string: null`) - The StorageClass to use for the
    servers' StatefulSet storage. It must be able to be dynamically provisioned if you want the storage
    to be automatically created. For example, to use [Local](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#local)
    storage classes, the PersistentVolumeClaims would need to be manually created.
    A `null` value will use the Kubernetes cluster's default StorageClass. If a default
    StorageClass does not exist, you will need to create one.

  - `connect` ((#v-server-connect)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable [Connect](/docs/connect). Setting this to true _will not_ automatically secure pod communication, this
    setting will only enable usage of the feature. Consul will automatically initialize
    a new CA and set of certificates. Additional Connect settings can be configured
    by setting the `server.extraConfig` value.

  - `resources` ((#v-server-resources)) (`string: null`) - The resource requests (CPU, memory, etc.)
    for each of the server agents. This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes
    [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#resourcerequirements-v1-core)
    object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount
    of resources. **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    # Resources are defined as a formatted multi-line string:
    resources: |
      requests:
        memory: "10Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "10Gi"
    ```

  - `updatePartition` ((#v-server-updatepartition)) (`integer: 0`) - This value is used to carefully
    control a rolling update of Consul server agents. This value specifies the [partition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#partitions)
    for performing a rolling update. Please read the linked Kubernetes documentation
    for more information.

  - `disruptionBudget` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget)) - This configures the [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) for the server cluster.

    - `enabled` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable
      registering a PodDisruptionBudget for the server cluster. If this is enabled, it will only register the budget so long as the server cluster is enabled.

    - `maxUnavailable` ((#v-server-disruptionbudget-maxunavailable)) (`integer: null`) - The maximum
      number of unavailable pods. By default, this will be automatically computed based on the `server.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`. If you need to set this to `0`, you will need to add a `--set 'server.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'` flag to the helm chart installation
      command because of a limitation in the Helm templating language.

  - `extraConfig` ((#v-server-extraconfig)) (`string: "{}"`) - A raw string of extra JSON
    [configuration](/docs/agent/options) for Consul servers. This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Consul server agents. This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

    ```yaml
    # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
    extraConfig: |
      {
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
      }
    ```

    This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (consul-helm v0.7.0 and later), using the following syntax:

    ```shell
    --set 'server.extraConfig="{"log_level": "DEBUG"}"'
    ```

  - `extraVolumes` ((#v-server-extravolumes)) (`array: []`) - A list of extra volumes to mount for server agents. This
    is useful for bringing in extra data that can be referenced by other configurations
    at a well known path, such as TLS certificates or Gossip encryption keys. The
    value of this should be a list of objects. Each object supports the following
    keys:

    - `type` ((#v-server-extravolumes-type)) (`string: required`) - Type of the volume, must be one of
      "configMap" or "secret". Case sensitive.

    - `name` ((#v-server-extravolumes-name)) (`string: required`) - Name of the configMap or secret to
      be mounted. This also controls the path that it is mounted to. The volume will be mounted to `/consul/userconfig/<name>`.

    - `load` ((#v-server-extravolumes-load)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, then the agent will be
      configured to automatically load HCL/JSON configuration files from this volume with `-config-dir`. This defaults to false.

      ```yaml
      extraVolumes:
      -  type: "secret"
          name: "consul-certs"
          load: false
      ```

  - `affinity` ((#v-server-affinity)) (`string`) - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
    for server pods. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which
    minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need
    to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value
    to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: {{ template "consul.name" . }}
                release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
                component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    ```

  - `tolerations` ((#v-server-tolerations)) (`string: ""`) - Toleration settings for server pods. This
    should be a multi-line string matching the [Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) array in a Pod spec.

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-server-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
    labels for server pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-server-priorityclassname)) (`string`) - This value references an existing
    Kubernetes [priorityClassName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority) that can be assigned to server pods.

  - `annotations` ((#v-server-annotations)) (`string`) - This value defines additional annotations for
    server pods. This should be a formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `service` ((#v-server-service)) - Server service properties

    - `annotations` ((#v-server-service-annotations)) Annotations to apply to the server service.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "annotation-key": "annotation-value"
      ```

- `externalServers` ((#v-externalservers)) - Configuration for Consul servers when the servers are running outside of Kubernetes.
  When running external servers, configuring these values is recommended
  if setting `global.tls.enableAutoEncrypt` to true (requires consul-k8s >= 0.13.0)
  or `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` to true (requires consul-k8s >= 0.14.0).

  - `enabled` ((#v-externalservers-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will be configured to talk to the external servers.
    If setting this to true, you must also set `server.enabled` to false.

  - `hosts` ((#v-externalservers-hosts)) (`array<string>: null`) - An array of external Consul server hosts that are used to make
    HTTPS connections from the components in this Helm chart.
    Valid values include IPs, DNS names, or Cloud auto-join string.
    The port must be provided separately below.
    Note: `client.join` must also be set to the hosts that should be
    used to join the cluster. In most cases, the `client.join` values
    should be the same, however, they may be different if you
    wish to use separate hosts for the HTTPS connections.

  - `httpsPort` ((#v-externalservers-httpsport)) (`integer: 8501`) - The HTTPS port of the Consul servers.

  - `tlsServerName` ((#v-externalservers-tlsservername)) (`string: null`) - The server name to use as the SNI host header when connecting with HTTPS.

  - `useSystemRoots` ((#v-externalservers-usesystemroots)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart will ignore the CA set in `global.tls.caCert`
    and will rely on the container's system CAs for TLS verification when talking to Consul servers. Otherwise, the chart will use `global.tls.caCert`.

  - `k8sAuthMethodHost` ((#v-externalservers-k8sauthmethodhost)) (`string: null`) - If you are setting `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` and
    `connectInject.enabled` to true, set `k8sAuthMethodHost` to the address of the Kubernetes API server.
    This address must be reachable from the Consul servers.
    Please see the [Kubernetes Auth Method documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/acl/auth-methods/kubernetes.html). Requires consul-k8s >= 0.14.0.

    You could retrieve this value from your `kubeconfig` by running:

    ```shell
    kubectl config view \
            -o jsonpath="{.clusters[?(@.name=='<your cluster name>')].cluster.server}"
    ```

- `client` ((#v-client)) - Values that configure running a Consul client on Kubernetes nodes.

  - `enabled` ((#v-client-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, the chart will install all
    the resources necessary for a Consul client on every Kubernetes node. This _does not_ require
    `server.enabled`, since the agents can be configured to join an external cluster.

  - `image` ((#v-client-image)) (`string: global.image`) - The name of the Docker image (including any
    tag) for the containers running Consul client agents.

  - `join` ((#v-client-join)) (`array<string>: null`) - A list of valid [`-retry-join` values](/docs/agent/options#retry-join). If this is `null` (default), then the clients will attempt to automatically join the server cluster running within Kubernetes. This means that with `server.enabled` set to true, clients will automatically join that cluster. If `server.enabled` is not true, then a value must be specified so the clients can join a valid cluster.

  - `dataDirectoryPath` ((#v-client-datadirectorypath)) (`string: null`) - An absolute path to a
    directory on the host machine to use as the Consul client data directory. If set to the empty string or null, the Consul agent will store its data in the Pod's local filesystem (which will
    be lost if the Pod is deleted). Security Warning: If setting this, Pod Security
    Policies _must_ be enabled on your cluster and in this Helm chart (via the global.enablePodSecurityPolicies setting) to prevent other Pods from mounting the same host path and gaining access to all of Consul's data. Consul's data is not encrypted at rest.

  - `grpc` ((#v-client-grpc)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, agents will enable their GRPC listener on
    port 8502 and expose it to the host. This will use slightly more resources, but is
    required for [Connect](/docs/k8s/connect).

  - `exposeGossipPorts` ((#v-client-exposegossipports)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the Helm chart
    will expose the clients' gossip ports as hostPorts. This is only necessary if pod IPs in the k8s cluster are not directly routable and the Consul servers are outside of the k8s cluster.
    This also changes the clients' advertised IP to the `hostIP` rather than `podIP`.

  - `resources` ((#v-client-resources)) (`string: null`) - The resource requests (CPU, memory, etc.)
    for each of the client agents. This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes
    [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources.

    ```yaml
    # Resources are defined as a formatted multi-line string:
    resources: |
      requests:
        memory: "10Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "10Gi"
    ```

  - `extraConfig` ((#v-client-extraconfig)) (`string: "{}"`) - A raw string of extra JSON
    [configuration](/docs/agent/options) for Consul clients. This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Consul agents. This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

    ```yaml
    # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
    extraConfig: |
      {
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
      }
    ```

    This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (consul-helm v0.7.0 and later), using the following syntax:

    ```shell
    --set 'client.extraConfig="{"log_level": "DEBUG"}"'
    ```

  - `extraVolumes` ((#v-client-extravolumes)) (`array: []`) - A list of extra volumes to mount for
    client agents. This is useful for bringing in extra data that can be referenced by other configurations at a well known path, such as TLS certificates or Gossip encryption keys. The
    value of this should be a list of objects. Each object supports the following
    keys:

    - `type` ((#v-client-extravolumes-type)) (`string: required`) - Type of the volume, must be one of
      "configMap" or "secret". Case sensitive.

    - `name` ((#v-client-extravolumes-name)) (`string: required`) - Name of the configMap or secret to
      be mounted. This also controls the path that it is mounted to. The volume will be mounted to `/consul/userconfig/<name>`.

      - `load` ((#v-client-extravolumes-load)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, then the agent will be
        configured to automatically load HCL/JSON configuration files from this volume with `-config-dir`. This defaults to false.

        ```yaml
        extraVolumes:
          - type: 'secret'
            name: 'consul-certs'
            load: false
        ```

  - `tolerations` ((#v-client-tolerations)) (`string: ""`) - Toleration Settings for client pods. This
    should be a multi-line string matching the Toleration array in a Pod spec. The example below will allow client pods to run on every node regardless of taints.

    ```yaml
    tolerations: |
      - operator: "Exists"
    ```

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-client-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - Labels for client pod assignment,
    formatted as a multi-line string. Please see [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) for more details.

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `priorityClassName` ((#v-client-priorityclassname)) (`string: ""`) - This value references an
    existing Kubernetes [priorityClassName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#pod-priority) that can be assigned to client pods.

  - `annotations` ((#v-client-annotations)) (`string: null`) - This value defines additional
    annotations for client pods. This should be a formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `dnsPolicy` ((#v-client-dnspolicy)) (`string: null`) - This value defines the [Pod DNS policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy)
    for client pods to use.

  - `updateStrategy` ((#v-client-updatestrategy)) (`string: null`) - The [update strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-daemon/update-daemon-set/#daemonset-update-strategy)
    for the client `DaemonSet`.

    ```yaml
    updateStrategy: |
      rollingUpdate:
        maxUnavailable: 5
      type: RollingUpdate
    ```

  - `snapshotAgent` ((#v-client-snapshotagent)) <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Values for setting up and running [snapshot agents](/docs/commands/snapshot/agent)
    within the Consul clusters. They are required to be co-located with Consul clients,
    so will inherit the clients' nodeSelector, tolerations and affinity.

    - `enabled` ((#v-client-snapshotagent-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will
      install resources necessary to run the snapshot agent.

    - `replicas` ((#v-client-snapshotagent-replicas)) (`integer: 2`) - The number of snapshot agents
      to run.

    - `configSecret` ((#v-client-snapshotagent-configsecret)) - A Kubernetes secret that should be
      manually created to contain the entire config to be used on the snapshot agent. This is the preferred method of configuration since there are usually storage credentials present. Please see [Snapshot agent config](/docs/commands/snapshot/agent#config-file-options) for details.

      - secretName ((#v-client-snapshotagent-configsecret-secretname)) `(string: null)` - The name of the Kubernetes secret.

      - secretKey ((#v-client-snapshotagent-configsecret-secretkey)) `(string: null)` - The key of the Kubernetes secret.

- `dns` ((#v-dns)) - Values that configure Consul DNS service.

  - `enabled` ((#v-dns-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, a `consul-dns` service will be
    created that exposes port 53 for TCP and UDP to the running Consul agents (servers and
    clients). This can then be used to [configure kube-dns](/docs/k8s/dns).
    The Helm chart _does not_ automatically configure kube-dns.

  - `clusterIP` ((#v-dns-clusterip)) (`string: null`) - If defined, this value configures the cluster
    IP of the DNS service.

  - `annotations` ((#v-dns-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Extra annotations to attach to the DNS
    service. This should be a multi-line string of annotations to apply to the DNS service.

- `syncCatalog` ((#v-synccatalog)) - Values that configure the [service sync](/docs/k8s/service-sync) process.

  - `enabled` ((#v-synccatalog-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will install all the
    resources necessary for the catalog sync process to run.

  - `image` ((#v-synccatalog-image)) (`string: global.imageK8S`) - The name of the Docker image
    (including any tag) for [consul-k8s](/docs/k8s#getting-started-with-consul-and-kubernetes)
    to run the sync program.

  - `default` ((#v-synccatalog-default)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, all valid services in K8S are
    synced by default. If false, the service must be [annotated](/docs/k8s/service-sync#sync-enable-disable) properly to sync. In either case an annotation can override the default.

  - `toConsul` ((#v-synccatalog-toconsul)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, will sync Kubernetes services
    to Consul. This can be disabled to have a one-way sync.

  - `toK8S` ((#v-synccatalog-tok8s)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, will sync Consul services to
    Kubernetes. This can be disabled to have a one-way sync.

  - `k8sPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sprefix)) (`string: ""`) - A prefix to prepend to all services
    registered in Kubernetes from Consul. This defaults to `""` where no prefix is prepended; Consul services are synced with the same name to Kubernetes. (Consul -> Kubernetes sync only)

  - `k8sAllowNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sallownamespaces)) (`[]string: ["*"]`) - list of k8s
    namespaces to sync the k8s services from. If a k8s namespace is not included in this list or is listed in `k8sDenyNamespaces`, services in that k8s namespace will not be synced even if they are explicitly annotated. Use `["*"]` to automatically allow all k8s namespaces. For example,
    `["namespace1", "namespace2"]` will only allow services in the k8s namespaces
    `namespace1` and `namespace2` to be synced and registered with Consul. All other
    k8s namespaces will be ignored. Note: `k8sDenyNamespaces` takes precedence over
    values defined here. Requires consul-k8s v0.12+
  - `k8sDenyNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-k8sdenynamespaces)) (`[]string: ["kube-system", "kube-public"]` - list of k8s namespaces that should not have their services synced. This list takes precedence over `k8sAllowNamespaces`. `*` is not supported because then nothing would be allowed to sync. Requires consul-k8s v0.12+.

    For example, if `k8sAllowNamespaces` is `["*"]` and `k8sDenyNamespaces` is `["namespace1", "namespace2"]`, then all k8s namespaces besides `namespace1` and `namespace2` will be synced.

  - `k8sSourceNamespace` ((#v-synccatalog-k8ssourcenamespace)) (`string: ""`) - **[DEPRECATED] Use
    `k8sAllowNamespaces` and `k8sDenyNamespaces` instead.** `k8sSourceNamespace` is the Kubernetes namespace to watch for service changes and sync to Consul. If this is not set then it will default to all namespaces.

  - `consulNamespaces` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces)) <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - These settings manage
    the catalog sync's interaction with Consul namespaces (requires consul-ent v1.7+ and consul-k8s v0.12+). Also, `global.enableConsulNamespaces` must be true.

    - `consulDestinationNamespace` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-consuldestinationnamespace)) (`string: "default"`) - Name of the Consul namespace to register all k8s
      services into. If the Consul namespace does not already exist, it will be created.
      This will be ignored if `mirroringK8S` is true.

    - `mirroringK8S` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8s)) (`bool: false`) - causes k8s
      services to be registered into a Consul namespace of the same name as their k8s namespace, optionally prefixed if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set below. If the Consul namespace does not already exist, it will be created. Turning this on overrides the `consulDestinationNamespace` setting. `addK8SNamespaceSuffix` may no longer be needed if enabling this option.

    - `mirroringK8SPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8sprefix)) (`string: ""`) - If
      `mirroringK8S` is set to true, `mirroringK8SPrefix` allows each Consul namespace to be given a prefix. For example, if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set to `"k8s-"`, a service in the k8s `staging` namespace will be registered into the `k8s-staging` Consul namespace.

  - `addK8SNamespaceSuffix` ((#v-synccatalog-addk8snamespacesuffix)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, sync catalog will append Kubernetes namespace suffix to each service name synced to Consul, separated by a dash. For example, for a service `foo` in the `default` namespace, the sync process will create a Consul service named `foo-default`. Set this flag to true to avoid registering services with the same name but in different namespaces as instances for the same Consul service. Namespace suffix is not added if `annotationServiceName` is provided.

  - `consulPrefix` ((#v-synccatalog-consulPrefix)) (`string: ""`) - A prefix to prepend to all services registered in Consul from Kubernetes. This defaults to `""` where no prefix is prepended. Service names within Kubernetes remain unchanged. (Kubernetes -> Consul sync only) The prefix is ignored if `annotationServiceName` is provided.

  - `k8sTag` ((#v-synccatalog-k8stag)) (`string: null`) - An optional tag that is applied to all of the Kubernetes services that are synced into Consul. If nothing is set, this defaults to "k8s". (Kubernetes -> Consul sync only)

  - `syncClusterIPServices` ((#v-synccatalog-syncclusteripservices)) (`boolean: true`) - If true, will
    sync Kubernetes ClusterIP services to Consul. This can be disabled to have the sync ignore ClusterIP-type services.

  - `nodePortSyncType` ((#v-synccatalog-nodeportsynctype)) (`string: ExternalFirst`) - Configures the
    type of syncing that happens for NodePort services. The only valid options are: `ExternalOnly`, `InternalOnly`, and `ExternalFirst`. `ExternalOnly` will only use a node's ExternalIP address
    for the sync, otherwise the service will not be synced. `InternalOnly` uses the
    node's InternalIP address. `ExternalFirst` will preferentially use the node's
    ExternalIP address, but if it doesn't exist, it will use the node's InternalIP
    address instead.

  - `aclSyncToken` ((#v-synccatalog-acl-sync-token)) - references a Kubernetes [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#creating-your-own-secrets)
    that contains an existing Consul ACL token. This will provide the sync process
    the correct permissions. This is only needed if ACLs are enabled on the Consul
    cluster.

    - `secretName` ((#v-synccatalog-acl-sync-token-secret-name)) `(string: null)` - The name of the Kubernetes secret. This defaults to null.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-synccatalog-acl-sync-token-secret-key)) `(string: null)` - The key for the Kubernetes secret. This defaults to null.

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-synccatalog-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines
    [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) labels for `syncCatalog` pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `logLevel` ((#v-synccatalog-loglevel)) (`string: info`) - Log verbosity level. One of "trace",
    "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".

  - `consulWriteInterval` ((#v-synccatalog-consulwriteinterval)) (`string: null`) - Override the default interval to perform syncing operations creating Consul services.

- `ui` ((#v-ui)) - Values that configure the Consul UI.

  - `enabled` ((#v-ui-enabled)) (`boolean: global.enabled`) - If true, the UI will be enabled. This will
    only _enable_ the UI, it doesn't automatically register any service for external
    access. The UI will only be enabled on server agents. If `server.enabled` is
    false, then this setting has no effect. To expose the UI in some way, you must
    configure `ui.service`.

  - `service` ((#v-ui-service)) - This configures the `Service` resource registered for the Consul UI.

    - `enabled` ((#v-ui-service-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - This will enable/disable registering a
      Kubernetes Service for the Consul UI. This value only takes effect if `ui.enabled` is
      true and taking effect.

    - `type` ((#v-ui-service-type)) (`string: null`) - The service type to register. This defaults to
      `null` which doesn't set an explicit service type, which typically is defaulted to
      "ClusterIP" by Kubernetes. The available service types are documented on [the
      Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

    - `annotations` ((#v-ui-service-annotations)) (`string: null`) - Annotations to apply to the UI
      service.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "annotation-key": "annotation-value"
      ```

    - `additionalSpec` ((#v-ui-service-additionalspec)) (`string: null`) - Additional Service spec
      values. This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes `Service` object.

- `connectInject` ((#v-connectinject)) - Values that configure running the [Connect injector](/docs/k8s/connect).

  - `enabled` ((#v-connectinject-enabled)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the chart will install all the
    resources necessary for the Connect injector process to run. This will enable the injector but will
    require pods to opt-in with an annotation by default.

  - `image` ((#v-connectinject-image)) (`string: global.imageK8S`) - The name of the Docker image
    (including any tag) for the [consul-k8s](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s) binary.

  - `default` ((#v-connectinject-default)) (`boolean: false`) - If true, the injector will inject the
    Connect sidecar into all pods by default. Otherwise, pods must specify the. [injection annotation](/docs/k8s/connect#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-inject)
    to opt-in to Connect injection. If this is true, pods can use the same annotation
    to explicitly opt-out of injection.

  - `imageConsul` ((#v-connectinject-imageConsul)) (`string: global.image`) - The name of the Docker
    image (including any tag) for Consul. This is used for proxy service registration, Envoy configuration, etc.

  - `imageEnvoy` ((#v-connectinject-imageEnvoy)) (`string: ""`) - The name of the Docker image (including any tag) for the Envoy sidecar. `envoy` must be on the executable path within this image. This Envoy version must be compatible with the Consul version used by the injector. If not specified this defaults to letting the injector choose the Envoy image. Check [supported Envoy versions](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy.html#supported-versions) to ensure the version you are using is compatible with Consul.

  - `namespaceSelector` ((#v-connectinject-namespaceselector)) (`string: ""`) - A [selector](https://
    kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
    for restricting injection to only matching namespaces. By default all namespaces
    except `kube-system` and `kube-public` will have injection enabled.

    ```yaml
    namespaceSelector: |
      matchLabels:
        namespace-label: label-value
    ```

  - `k8sAllowNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-k8sallownamespaces)) - list of k8s namespaces to allow
    Connect sidecar injection in. If a k8s namespace is not included or is listed in `k8sDenyNamespaces`, pods in that k8s namespace will not be injected even if they are explicitly annotated. Use `["*"]` to automatically allow all k8s namespaces.

    For example, `["namespace1", "namespace2"]` will only allow pods in the k8s namespaces `namespace1` and `namespace2` to have Connect sidecars injected and registered with Consul. All other k8s namespaces will be ignored.

    Note: `k8sDenyNamespaces` takes precedence over values defined here and `namespaceSelector` takes precedence over both since it is applied first. `kube-system` and `kube-public` are never injected, even if included here. Requires consul-k8s v0.12+

  - `k8sDenyNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-k8sdenynamespaces)) - list of k8s namespaces that should not
    allow Connect sidecar injection. This list takes precedence over `k8sAllowNamespaces`. `*` is not supported because then nothing would be allowed to be injected.

    For example, if `k8sAllowNamespaces` is `["*"]` and `k8sDenyNamespaces` is `["namespace1", "namespace2"]`, then all k8s namespaces besides `namespace1` and `namespace2` will be injected.

    Note: `namespaceSelector` takes precedence over this since it is applied first. `kube-system` and `kube-public` are never injected. Requires consul-k8s v0.12+.

  - `consulNamespaces` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces)) <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - These settings manage
    the connect injector's interaction with Consul namespaces (requires consul-ent v1.7+ and consul-k8s v0.12+). Also, `global.enableConsulNamespaces` must be true.

    - `consulDestinationNamespace` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-consuldestinationnamespace))
      (`string: "default"`) - Name of the Consul namespace to register all k8s services into. If the Consul namespace does not already exist, it will be created.
      This will be ignored if `mirroringK8S` is true.

    - `mirroringK8S` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8s)) (`bool: false`) - causes k8s
      services to be registered into a Consul namespace of the same name as their k8s namespace, optionally prefixed if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set below. If the Consul namespace does not already exist, it will be created. Turning this on overrides the `consulDestinationNamespace` setting.

    - `mirroringK8SPrefix` ((#v-connectinject-consulnamespaces-mirroringk8sprefix)) (`string: ""`) - If
      `mirroringK8S` is set to true, `mirroringK8SPrefix` allows each Consul namespace to be given a prefix. For example, if `mirroringK8SPrefix` is set to `"k8s-"`, a service in the k8s `staging` namespace will be registered into the `k8s-staging` Consul namespace.

  - `certs` ((#v-connectinject-certs)) - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are
    configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook.
    By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires
    the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`.
    In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure
    the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` ((#v-connectinject-certs-secretname)) (`string: null`) - secretName is the name of
      the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` ((#v-connectinject-cabundle)) (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate
      bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string
      and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the
      Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified
      if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` ((#v-connectinject-certs-certname)) (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the
      certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

    - `keyName` ((#v-connectinject-certs-keyname)) (`string: "tls.key"`) - The name of the private key
      for the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

  - `nodeSelector` ((#v-connectinject-nodeselector)) (`string: null`) - This value defines
    [`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
    labels for `connectInject` pod assignment, formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector: |
      beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    ```

  - `aclBindingRuleSelector` ((#v-connectinject-acl-bindingrule-selector)) (`string: "serviceaccount.name!=default"`) - A [selector](/docs/acl/acl-auth-methods#binding-rules)
    for restricting automatic injection to only matching services based on their
    associated service account. By default, services using the `default` Kubernetes
    service account will be prevented from logging in. This only has effect if ACLs
    are enabled. Requires Consul 1.5+ and consul-k8s 0.8.0+.

  - `overrideAuthMethodName` ((#v-connectinject-overrideauthmethodname)) (`string: ""`) - If not using `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` and instead
    manually setting up an auth method for Connect inject, set this to the name of
    your Auth method.

  - `aclInjectToken` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken)) - Refers to a Kubernetes secret that you have created that contains an ACL token for your Consul cluster which allows the Connect injector the correct permissions. This is only needed if Consul namespaces and ACLs are enabled on the Consul cluster and you are not setting `global.acls.manageSystemACLs` to `true`. This token needs to have `operator = "write"` privileges so that it can create namespaces.

    - `secretName` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken-secretname)) `(string: null)` - The name of the Kubernetes secret.

    - `secretKey` ((#v-connectinject-aclinjecttoken-secretkey)) `(string: null)` - The key within the Kubernetes secret that holds the acl token.

  - `centralConfig` ((#v-connectinject-centralconfig)) - Values that configure Consul's [central configuration](/docs/agent/config_entries)
    feature (requires Consul v1.5+ and consul-k8s v0.8.1+).

    - `enabled` ((#v-connectinject-centralconfig-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) - Turns on the central
      configuration feature. Pods that have a Connect proxy injected will have their service automatically registered in this central configuration.

    - `defaultProtocol` ((#v-connectinject-centralconfig-defaultprotocol)) (`string: null`) - If
      defined, this value will be used as the default protocol type for all services registered with the central configuration. This can be overridden by using the [protocol annotation](/docs/k8s/connect#consul-hashicorp-com-connect-service-protocol) directly on any pod spec.

    - `proxyDefaults` ((#v-connectinject-centralconfig-proxydefaults)) (`string: "{}"`) - This value is
      a raw json string that will be applied to all Connect proxy sidecar pods. It can include any valid configuration for the configured proxy.

      ```yaml
      # proxyDefaults values are formatted as a multi-line string:
      proxyDefaults: |
        {
          "envoy_dogstatsd_url": "udp://127.0.0.1:9125"
        }
      ```

- `tests` ((#v-tests)) - Control whether to enable a test for this Helm chart.

  - `enabled` ((#v-tests-enabled)) (`boolean: true`) If true, the test Pod manifest will be generated
    to be used as a Helm test. The pod will be created when a `helm test` command is executed.

## Helm Chart Examples

The below `config.yaml` results in a single server Consul cluster with a `LoadBalancer` to allow external access to the UI and API.

```yaml
# config.yaml
server:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapExpect: 1

ui:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

The below `config.yaml` results in a three server Consul Enterprise cluster with 100GB of storage and automatic Connect injection.

Note, this would require a secret that contains the enterprise license key.

```yaml
# config.yaml
global:
  image: 'hashicorp/consul-enterprise:1.4.2-ent'

server:
  replicas: 3
  bootstrapExpect: 3
  enterpriseLicense:
    secretName: 'consul-license'
    secretKey: 'key'
  storage: 100Gi
  connect: true

client:
  grpc: true

connectInject:
  enabled: true
  default: false
```

## Customizing the Helm Chart

Consul within Kubernetes is highly configurable and the Helm chart contains dozens
of the most commonly used configuration options.
If you need to extend the Helm chart with additional options, we recommend using a third-party tool,
such as [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) or [ship](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship).
Note that the Helm chart heavily relies on Helm lifecycle hooks, and so features like bootstrapping ACLs or TLS
will not work as expected. Additionally, we can make changes to the internal implementation (e.g., renaming template files) that
may be backward incompatible with such customizations.
