# Connect HTTP Endpoint

The `/connect` endpoints provide access to
[Connect-related](/docs/connect/index.html) operations for
intentions and the certificate authority.

There are also Connect-related endpoints in the
[Agent](/api/agent.html) and [Catalog](/api/catalog.html) APIs. For example,
the API for requesting a TLS certificate for a service is part of the agent
APIs. And the catalog API has an endpoint for finding all Connect-capable
services in the catalog.

Please choose a sub-section in the navigation for more information.
