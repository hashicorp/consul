# Catalog HTTP API

The `/catalog` endpoints register and deregister nodes, services, and checks in
Consul. The catalog should not be confused with the agent, since some of the
API methods look similar.

## Register Entity

This endpoint is a low-level mechanism for registering or updating
entries in the catalog. It is usually preferable to instead use the
[agent endpoints](/api/agent.html) for registration as they are simpler and
perform [anti-entropy](/docs/internals/anti-entropy.html).

| Method | Path                | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/catalog/register` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking.html),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency.html),
[agent caching](/api/features/caching.html), and
[required ACLs](/api#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `node:write,service:write` |

### Parameters

- `ID` `(string: "")` - An optional UUID to assign to the node. This must be a 36-character UUID-formatted string.

- `Node` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the node ID to register.

- `Address` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the address to register.

- `Datacenter` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter, which defaults to the
  agent's datacenter if not provided.

- `TaggedAddresses` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - Specifies the tagged
  addresses.

- `NodeMeta` `(map<string|string>: nil)` - Specifies arbitrary KV metadata
  pairs for filtering purposes.

- `Service` `(Service: nil)` - Specifies to register a service. If `ID` is not
  provided, it will be defaulted to the value of the `Service.Service` property.
  Only one service with a given `ID` may be present per node. We recommend using
  [valid DNS labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames)
  for service definition names for [compatibility with external DNS](/docs/agent/services.html#service-and-tag-names-with-dns).
  The service `Tags`, `Address`, `Meta`, and `Port` fields are all optional. For more
  information about these fields and the implications of setting them,
  see the [Service - Agent API](/api/agent/service.html) page
  as registering services differs between using this or the Services Agent endpoint.

- `Check` `(Check: nil)` - Specifies to register a check. The register API
  manipulates the health check entry in the Catalog, but it does not setup the
  script, TTL, or HTTP check to monitor the node's health. To truly enable a new
  health check, the check must either be provided in agent configuration or set
  via the [agent endpoint](agent.html).

  The `CheckID` can be omitted and will default to the value of `Name`. As
  with `Service.ID`, the `CheckID` must be unique on this node. `Notes` is an
  opaque field that is meant to hold human-readable text. If a `ServiceID` is
  provided that matches the `ID` of a service on that node, the check is
  treated as a service level health check, instead of a node level health
  check. The `Status` must be one of `passing`, `warning`, or `critical`.

  The `Definition` field can be provided with details for a TCP or HTTP health
  check. For more information, see the [Health Checks](/docs/agent/checks.html) page.

  Multiple checks can be provided by replacing `Check` with `Checks` and
  sending an array of `Check` objects.

- `SkipNodeUpdate` `(bool: false)` - Specifies whether to skip updating the
  node's information in the registration. This is useful in the case where
  only a health check or service entry on a node needs to be updated or when
  a register request is intended to update a service entry or health check.
  In both use cases, node information will not be overwritten, if the node is
  already registered. Note, if the parameter is enabled for a node that doesn't
  exist, it will still be created.

- `ns` `(string: "")` - **(Enterprise Only)** Specifies the namespace in which the
  service and checks will be registered. This value may be provided by either the
  `ns` URL query parameter or in the `X-Consul-Namespace` header. Additionally,
  the namespace may be provided within the `Service` or `Check` fields but if
  present in multiple places, they must all be the same. If not provided at all,
  the namespace will be inherited from the request's ACL token or will default
  to the `default` namespace. Added in Consul 1.7.0.

It is important to note that `Check` does not have to be provided with `Service`
and vice versa. A catalog entry can have either, neither, or both.

## Deregister Entity

This endpoint is a low-level mechanism for directly removing
entries from the Catalog. It is usually preferable to instead use the
[agent endpoints](/api/agent.html) for deregistration as they are simpler and
perform [anti-entropy](/docs/internals/anti-entropy.html).

| Method | Path                  | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/catalog/deregister` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking.html),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency.html),
[agent caching](/api/features/caching.html), and
[required ACLs](/api#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `NO`             | `none`            | `none`        | `node:write,service:write` |

### Parameters

The behavior of the endpoint depends on what keys are provided.

- `Node` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the ID of the node. If no other
  values are provided, this node, all its services, and all its checks are
  removed.

- `Datacenter` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter, which defaults to the
  agent's datacenter if not provided.

- `CheckID` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of the check to remove.

- `ServiceID` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of the service to remove. The
  service and all associated checks will be removed.

- `Namespace` `(string: "")` - **(Enterprise Only)** Specifies the namespace in which the
  service and checks will be deregistered. If not provided in the JSON body, the value of
  the `ns` URL query parameter or the `X-Consul-Namespace` header will be used.
  If not provided at all, the namespace will be inherited from the request's ACL
  token or will default to the `default` namespace. Added in Consul 1.7.0.

### Sample Payloads

```json
{
  "Datacenter": "dc1",
  "Node": "foobar"
}
```

```json
{
  "Datacenter": "dc1",

## List Datacenters

This endpoint returns the list of all known datacenters. The datacenters will be
sorted in ascending order based on the estimated median round trip time from the
server to the servers in that datacenter.

This endpoint does not require a cluster leader and will succeed even during an
availability outage. Therefore, it can be used as a simple check to see if any
Consul servers are routable.

| Method | Path                   | Produces           |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ |

## List Nodes for Connect-capable Service

This endpoint returns the nodes providing a
[Connect-capable](/docs/connect) service in a given datacenter.
This will include both proxies and native integrations. A service may
register both Connect-capable and incapable services at the same time,
so this endpoint may be used to filter only the Connect-capable endpoints.

| Method | Path                        | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/catalog/connect/:service` | `application/json` |

Parameters and response format are the same as
[`/catalog/service/:service`](/api/catalog.html#list-nodes-for-service).

## Retrieve Map of Services for a Node

This endpoint returns the node's registered services.

| Method | Path                  | Produces           |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/catalog/node/:node` | `application/json` |

The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/api/features/blocking.html),
[consistency modes](/api/features/consistency.html),
[agent caching](/api/features/caching.html), and
[required ACLs](/api#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching | ACL Required             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `YES`            | `all`             | `none`        | `node:read,service:read` |

### Parameters

- `node` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the node for which
  to list services. This is specified as part of the URL.

- `dc` `(string: "")` - Specifies the datacenter to query. This will default to
  the datacenter of the agent being queried. This is specified as part of the
  URL as a query parameter.

- `filter` `(string: "")` - Specifies the expression used to filter the
  queries results prior to returning the data.

- `ns` `(string: "")` - **(Enterprise Only)** Specifies the namespace to list services.
  This value may be provided by either the `ns` URL query parameter or in the
  `X-Consul-Namespace` header. If not provided at all, the namespace will be inherited
  from the request's ACL token or will default to the `default` namespace. Added in Consul 1.7.0.
