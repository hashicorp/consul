// The protohcl package aims to define a canonical way to translate between
// protobuf and HCL encodings of data.
//
// Similar to google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson it intends to be
// opinionated about what the canonical HCL representation of a protobuf type
// should be.
//
// As HCL is a user centric data format as opposed to JSON/Protobuf which
// are intended to be used more by machines, efficiency is not a primary goal
// of this package as it is expected that users are either doing the encoding to and
// decoding from HCL at the edge (such as within the Consul CLI) or that even
// when done on servers, the rate that servers perform these translations should
// be low enough to have any inefficiency produce a tangible performance impact.
//
// HCL has two different syntaxes that could be used to represent data: attribute and block
//
// This implementation chooses to represent primitive values, enums and the well known wrapper types and
// collections of these values (maps and repeated fields) with attribute syntax. Other messages and collections
// with message value types will be represented with block syntax for example
//
// message Foo {
//    map<string, int32> map_of_ints = 1;
//	   map<string, OtherMessage> map_of_messages = 2;
// }
//
// would have HCL like:
//
// map_of_ints = {
//    "foo": 1,
//    "bar": 2,
// }
// map_of_messages "foo" {
//    ...other fields
// }
// map_of_messages "bar" {
//    ...other fields
// }
//
// Similar goes for list of primitives vs list of messages (except the block syntax uses no labels). The differences
// between primitive fields outside of a collection and a message field really just amounts to not having to specify
// the "=" between the field name and the "{" character.
