// Backend provides the low-level storage substrate for resources. It can be

// storage systems.
//
// Refer to the method comments for details of the behaviors and invariants
// provided, which are also verified by the conformance test suite in the
// internal/storage/conformance package.
//
// Cross-cutting concerns:
//
// # UIDs
//
// Users identify resources with a name of their choice (e.g. service "billing")
// but internally, we add our own identifier in the Uid field to disambiguate
// references when resources are deleted and re-created with the same name.
//
// # GroupVersion
//
// In order to support automatic translation between schema versions, we only
// store a single version of a resource, and treat types with the same Group
// and Kind, but different GroupVersions, as equivalent.
//
// # Read-Modify-Write Patterns
//
// All writes at the storage backend level are CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations
// where the caller must provide the resource in its entirety, with the current
// version string.
//
// Non-CAS writes should be implemented at a higher level (i.e. in the Resource
// Service) by reading the resource, applying the user's requested modifications,
// and writing it back. This allows us to ensure we're correctly carrying over
// the resource's Status and Uid, without requiring support for partial update
// or "patch" operations from external storage systems.
//
// In cases where there are concurrent interleaving writes made to a resource,
// it's likely that a CAS operation will fail, so callers may need to put their
// Read-Modify-Write cycle in a retry loop.

	// reads.

	// If id.Uid is non-empty, Read will only return a resource if its Uid matches,
