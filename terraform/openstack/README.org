* 1. Pre-requisites
  - Populate all variables in your terraform.tfvars
    #+BEGIN_SRC terraform
    username = "..."
    password = "..."
    tenant_name = "..."
    auth_url = "https://myopenstackprovider.com/identity/v2.0"
    public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB..."
    key_file_path = "..."
    #+END_SRC
  - Change regions, networks, flavor and image ids in the variables.tf
    according to your openstack settings
  - Use an "upstart" compatible image for your consul nodes

* 2. Test it

  : terraform apply

* 3. Terraform as a module

  You should now be able to use openstack as a provider for the consul module.
  #+BEGIN_SRC terraform
  module "consul" {
    source = "github.com/hashicorp/consul/terraform/openstack"
    servers = 3
  }
  #+END_SRC
