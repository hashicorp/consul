Hi [insert supervisor’s name],

I’d like to attend API Summit Live 2025, October 14-15 in New York City. At API Summit, I am guaranteed to learn a ton, spending two whole days with Kong experts and networking with other customers. Past attendees and speakers include companies like Goldman Sachs, IKEA, Siemens, Uber, GSK, and much more. I can bring learnings back to help our company:

* Roll out AI and LLM projects with built-in security, reliability, and compliance guardrails.
* Simplify management of traffic across multiple services and multiple clouds.
* Secure, govern, discover, and observe event streams in your API platform.

The estimated cost to attend the conference will be:

Registration fee: $495
Domestic airfare estimate: $500
Hotel (3 nights at average NYC rate): $250 per night / $750 + taxes and fees
Total: $1,745

After API Summit, I’ll plan to assemble a report summarizing what I learned and how we can implement it at our company.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your reply!
