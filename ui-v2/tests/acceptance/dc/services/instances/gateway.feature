Feature: dc / services / instances / gateway: Show Gateway Service Instance
  Scenario: A Gateway Service instance
    Given 1 datacenter model with the value "dc1"
    And 1 instance model from yaml
    ---
    - Service:
        Kind: mesh-gateway
        Name: gateway
        ID: gateway-with-id
        TaggedAddresses:
          lan:

    When I visit the instance page for yaml
    ---
      dc: dc1
      service: gateway
      node: node-0
      id: gateway-with-id

    Then the url should be /dc1/services/gateway/node-0/gateway-with-id

    And I see serviceChecksIsSelected on the tabs

    When I click addresses on the tabs
    And I see addressesIsSelected on the tabs
    And I see 2 of the addresses object
    And I see address on the addresses like yaml
