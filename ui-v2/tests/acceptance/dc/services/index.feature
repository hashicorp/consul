    When I visit the services page for yaml
    ---
      dc: dc-1

    Then the url should be /dc-1/services
    And the title should be "Services - Consul"
    Then I see 4 service models
    And I see externalSource on the services like yaml

    - consul
    - nomad
    - terraform
    - kubernetes
