  Scenario:
    Given 1 datacenter model with the value "dc-1"
    And 6 node models from yaml
    ---
      - Node: Node-A
        Checks:
          - Status: critical
      - Node: Node-B
        Checks:
          - Status: passing
      - Node: Node-C
        Checks:
          - Status: warning
      - Node: Node-D
        Checks:
          - Status: critical
      - Node: Node-E
        Checks:
          - Status: critical
      - Node: Node-F
        Checks:
          - Status: warning
