# This script ensures that all of the protobuf packages present in the
# github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane library are referenced in the consul
# codebase somewhere so that the ultimate binary doesn't eliminate those
# packages. When the packages are linked in they use proto.RegisterFile() to
# globally register the types in the protobuf machinery so that they are
# available for decoding.
#
# We primarily need this for the Escape Hatch feature where users can provide
# arbitrary xDS JSON for Consul to decode. If extension points use *any.Any and
# use an extention package that Consul itself doesn't use then it won't decode
# unless the package is linked into the binary.
