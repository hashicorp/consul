# Azure Active Directory plugin for client authentication

This plugin provides an integration with Azure Active Directory device flow. If no tokens are present in the kubectl configuration, it will prompt a device code which can be used to login in a browser. After login it will automatically fetch the tokens and store them in the kubectl configuration. In addition it will refresh and update the tokens in the configuration when expired.

## Usage

1. Create an Azure Active Directory *Web App / API* application for `apiserver` following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-app-registration). The callback URL does not matter (just cannot be empty).

2. Create a second Azure Active Directory native application for `kubectl`. The callback URL does not matter (just cannot be empty).

3. On `kubectl` application's configuration page in Azure portal grant permissions to `apiserver` application by clicking on *Required Permissions*, click the *Add* button and search for the apiserver application created in step 1. Select "Access apiserver" under the *DELEGATED PERMISSIONS*. Once added click the *Grant Permissions* button to apply the changes.

4. Configure the `apiserver` to use the Azure Active Directory as an OIDC provider with following options

   ```
   --oidc-client-id="spn:APISERVER_APPLICATION_ID" \
   --oidc-issuer-url="https://sts.windows.net/TENANT_ID/"
   --oidc-username-claim="sub"
   ```

   * Replace the `APISERVER_APPLICATION_ID` with the application ID of `apiserver` application
   * Replace `TENANT_ID` with your tenant ID.
 Â  * For a list of alternative username claims that are supported by the OIDC issuer check the JSON response at `https://sts.windows.net/TENANT_ID/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

5. Configure `kubectl` to use the `azure` authentication provider

   ```
   kubectl config set-credentials "USER_NAME" --auth-provider=azure \
     --auth-provider-arg=environment=AzurePublicCloud \
     --auth-provider-arg=client-id=APPLICATION_ID \
     --auth-provider-arg=tenant-id=TENANT_ID \
     --auth-provider-arg=apiserver-id=APISERVER_APPLICATION_ID
   ```

   * Supported environments: `AzurePublicCloud`, `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`, `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureGermanCloud`
   * Replace `USER_NAME` and `TENANT_ID` with your user name and tenant ID
   * Replace `APPLICATION_ID` with the application ID of your`kubectl` application ID
   * Replace `APISERVER_APPLICATION_ID` with the application ID of your `apiserver` application ID
   * Be sure to also (create and) select a context that uses above user

 6. The access token is acquired when first `kubectl` command is executed

   ```
   kubectl get pods

   To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code DEC7D48GA to authenticate.
   ```

   * After signing in a web browser, the token is stored in the configuration, and it will be reused when executing further commands.
   * The resulting username in Kubernetes depends on your [configuration of the `--oidc-username-claim` and `--oidc-username-prefix` flags on the API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server). If you are using any authorization method you need to give permissions to that user, e.g. by binding the user to a role in the case of RBAC.
