# CHANGELOG

## v10.15.3

### Bug Fixes

- Initialize the polling URL and method for an LRO tracker on each iteration, favoring the Azure-AsyncOperation header.

## v10.15.2

### Bug Fixes

- Use fmt.Fprint when printing request/response so that any escape sequences aren't treated as format specifiers.

## v10.15.1

### Bug Fixes

- If an LRO API returns a ```Failed``` provisioning state in the initial response return an error at that point so the caller doesn't have to poll.
- For failed LROs without an OData v4 error include the response body in the error's ```AdditionalInfo``` field to aid in diagnosing the failure.

## v10.15.0

### New Features

- Add initial support for request/response logging via setting environment variables.
  Setting ```AZURE_GO_SDK_LOG_LEVEL``` to ```LogInfo``` will log request/response
  without their bodies.  To include the bodies set the log level to ```LogDebug```.
  By default the logger writes to strerr, however it can also write to stdout or a file
  if specified in ```AZURE_GO_SDK_LOG_FILE```.  Note that if the specified file
  already exists it will be truncated.
  IMPORTANT: by default the logger will redact the Authorization and Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key
  headers.  Any other secrets will *not* be redacted.

## v10.14.0

### New Features

- Added package version that contains version constants and user-agent data.

### Bug Fixes

- Add the user-agent to token requests.

## v10.13.0

## v10.12.0

### New Features

- Added field ServicePrincipalToken.MaxMSIRefreshAttempts to configure the maximun number of attempts to refresh an MSI token.

## v10.11.4

### Bug Fixes

- If an LRO returns http.StatusOK on the initial response with no async headers return the response body from Future.GetResult().
- If there is no "final GET URL" return an error from Future.GetResult().

## v10.11.3

### Bug Fixes

- In IMDS retry logic, if we don't receive a response don't retry.
  - Renamed the retry function so it's clear it's meant for IMDS only.
- For error response bodies that aren't OData-v4 compliant stick the raw JSON in the ServiceError.Details field so the information isn't lost.
  - Also add the raw HTTP response to the DetailedResponse.
- Removed superfluous wrapping of response error in azure.DoRetryWithRegistration().

## v10.11.2

## v7.3.0

  connections more readily.

- Adding ACR suffix to public cloud environment.
- Updating Glide dependencies.

## v7.2.5
- Fixed the Active Directory endpoint for the China cloud.

## v7.0.4
- Better error messages for long running operation failures

## v7.0.3
- Corrected DoPollForAsynchronous to properly handle the initial response

## v7.0.2
- Corrected DoPollForAsynchronous to continue using the polling method first discovered

## v7.0.1

- Fixed polling support for GET calls
- Changed format name from TimeRfc1123 to TimeRFC1123

## v7.0.0
- Added ByCopying responder with supporting TeeReadCloser
- Rewrote Azure asynchronous handling
- Reverted to only unmarshalling JSON
- Corrected handling of RFC3339 time strings and added support for Rfc1123 time format

The `json.Decoder` does not catch bad data as thoroughly as `json.Unmarshal`. Since
`encoding/json` successfully deserializes all core types, and extended types normally provide
their custom JSON serialization handlers, the code has been reverted back to using
`json.Unmarshal`. The original change to use `json.Decode` was made to reduce duplicate
code; there is no loss of function, and there is a gain in accuracy, by reverting.

Additionally, Azure services indicate requests to be polled by multiple means. The existing code
only checked for one of those (that is, the presence of the `Azure-AsyncOperation` header).
The new code correctly covers all cases and aligns with the other Azure SDKs.

## v6.1.0
- Introduced `date.ByUnmarshallingJSONDate` and `date.ByUnmarshallingJSONTime` to enable JSON encoded values.

## v6.0.0
- Completely reworked the handling of polled and asynchronous requests
- Removed unnecessary routines
- Reworked `mocks.Sender` to replay a series of `http.Response` objects
- Added `PrepareDecorators` for primitive types (e.g., bool, int32)

Handling polled and asynchronous requests is no longer part of `Client#Send`. Instead new
`SendDecorators` implement different styles of polled behavior. See`autorest.DoPollForStatusCodes`
and `azure.DoPollForAsynchronous` for examples.

## v5.0.0
- Added new RespondDecorators unmarshalling primitive types
- Corrected application of inspection and authorization PrependDecorators

## v4.0.0
- Added support for Azure long-running operations.
- Added cancelation support to all decorators and functions that may delay.
- Breaking: `DelayForBackoff` now accepts a channel, which may be nil.

## v3.1.0
- Add support for OAuth Device Flow authorization.
- Add support for ServicePrincipalTokens that are backed by an existing token, rather than other secret material.
- Add helpers for persisting and restoring Tokens.
- Increased code coverage in the github.com/Azure/autorest/azure package

## v3.0.0
- Breaking: `NewErrorWithError` no longer takes `statusCode int`.
- Breaking: `NewErrorWithStatusCode` is replaced with `NewErrorWithResponse`.
- Breaking: `Client#Send()` no longer takes `codes ...int` argument.
- Add: XML unmarshaling support with `ByUnmarshallingXML()`
- Stopped vending dependencies locally and switched to [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide).
  Applications using this library should either use Glide or vendor dependencies locally some other way.
- Add: `azure.WithErrorUnlessStatusCode()` decorator to handle Azure errors.
- Fix: use `net/http.DefaultClient` as base client.
- Fix: Missing inspection for polling responses added.
- Add: CopyAndDecode helpers.
- Improved `./autorest/to` with `[]string` helpers.
- Removed golint suppressions in .travis.yml.

## v2.1.0

- Added `StatusCode` to `Error` for more easily obtaining the HTTP Reponse StatusCode (if any)

## v2.0.0

- Changed WithHeader PrepareDecorator to use set vs. add
- Added JSON to error when unmarshalling fails
