Step 1: Read Our Guides
========================

There are two introductory guides you should read before proceeding:

* [CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md): The Contributing guide is a detailed
  document which describes the different ways you can contribute to Gophercloud
  and how to get started. This tutorial you're reading is very similar to that
  guide, but presented in a different way. We still recommend you read it over.

* [STYLE](/docs/STYLEGUIDE.md): The Style Guide documents coding conventions used
  in the Gophercloud project.

When you've finished reading those guides, proceed to [Step 2](step-02-issues.md).
