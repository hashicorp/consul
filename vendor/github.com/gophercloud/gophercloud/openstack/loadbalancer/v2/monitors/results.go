// Monitor represents a load balancer health monitor. A health monitor is used
// to determine whether or not back-end members of the VIP's pool are usable
// for processing a request. A pool can have several health monitors associated
// with it. There are different types of health monitors supported:
//
// PING: used to ping the members using ICMP.
// TCP: used to connect to the members using TCP.
// HTTP: used to send an HTTP request to the member.
// HTTPS: used to send a secure HTTP request to the member.
//
// When a pool has several monitors associated with it, each member of the pool
// is monitored by all these monitors. If any monitor declares the member as
// unhealthy, then the member status is changed to INACTIVE and the member
// won't participate in its pool's load balancing. In other words, ALL monitors
// must declare the member to be healthy for it to stay ACTIVE.

	// value.
	Timeout int `json:"timeout"`

	// Number of allowed connection failures before changing the status of the
	// member to INACTIVE. A valid value is from 1 to 10.
