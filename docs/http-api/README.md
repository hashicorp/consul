# HTTP API

Work in progress. This section will eventually contain docs about:

* the HTTP "framework"
* HTTP endpoints
* the [api](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/tree/main/api) client library - the `api` package
  provides an official Go API client for Consul, which is also used by Consul's
  [CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/docs/commands/index.html) commands to communicate with the local Consul agent.
