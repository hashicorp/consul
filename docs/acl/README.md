# ACL

This section is a work in progress.

The ACL subsystem is responsible for authenticating and authorizing access to Consul
operations ([HTTP API], and [RPC]). 

[HTTP API]: ../http-api
[RPC]: ../rpc

## ACL Entities

There are many entities in the ACL subsystem. The diagram below shows the relationship
between the entities.

ACL Tokens are at the center of the ACL system. Tokens are associated with a set of
Policies, and Roles.

AuthMethods, which consist of BindingRules, are a mechanism for creating ACL Tokens from
policies stored in external systems (ex: kubernetes, JWT, or OIDC).

Roles are a set of policies associated with a named role, and ServiceIdentity and
NodeIdentity are policy templates that are associated with a specific service or node and
can be rendered into a full policy.

Each Policy contains a set of rules. Each rule relates to a specific resource, and
includes an AccessLevel (read, write, list, or deny).

An ACL Token can be resolved into an Authorizer. The Authorizer is what is used by the
[HTTP API], and [RPC] endpoints to determine if an operation is allowed or forbidden (the
enforcement decision).
